> My research interests are Physical Metallurgy, Aerospace Materials, Ceramic & Composite Materials

## Where did you get your internship and why did you apply there? 
### What interested you or attracted you to this particular internship and why?

Bell Helicopter-Textron India Private Limited (TIPL). <br>
The company visited the campus for the first time and were looking for people for their newly formed Team Innovation-an extended part of the company's R&D. As aerospace engineering is a highly interesting field for me, I applied for the intern offer.

## How did you get your internship? 
### Was it through the college or off-campus or through a senior/prof or through an internship website?

The company visited the campus in the odd semester. There was an online test in the beginning based on which a few of us were shortlisted. Based on the Technical & HR interview, 3 people were selected.

## What was your internship about?

As a materials engineer, my project was broadly titled as - Future Materials Research. It involved a lot of learning on how an aircraft works, how it's manufactured, aerodynamics, electrical aspects and materials selection. Based on these, I had to work on novel materials for future helicopters.

## How was the work culture?

The working environment is very relaxed and healthy. The office timings were 9am-6pm, but the interns were relieved from strictly following it. It is definitely a target-based approach.

## What did you learn during the internship? 
### Was it challenging for you to do it? What new skills did you develop?

The internship helped me widen my knowledge base to a very large extent. I have a sound understanding about the aircraft working, primarily on the materials side.

The outcome of our Research was on the new technologies for future aircrafts. During the internship, we came up with a lot of novel ideas which are eligible for future patents.

## Tell us about the fun/ interesting incidents during the course of your internship.

I had a study tour to Dynamatic Technologies Limited (DTL) where composite cabins were being manufactured for Bell Helicopter. There were a lot of active activity clubs like Toastmasters Club, Sports Committee, Food Committee etc. The company served cuisines of different parts of the country at a subsidized rate.

## What advice would you give to juniors regarding your internship?
### Would you recommend a junior undergoing a similar internship at the same place you went?

Definitely. If you are looking for an industrial R&D in the aerospace and aviation sector, this is a place you would love to work in.
