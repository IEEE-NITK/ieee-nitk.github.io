## Insight 2k17 - CompSoc Talk

Insight 2k17, the first event for IEEE NITK Student Chapter started off with a huge response from the Computer Science Community at NITK with a jam-packed hall of students turning up to attend the talk given by final years. The talk was mainly focussed on tips and tricks to apply for research and industry internships off-campus.

The talk was given by three final years:
1. Natasha Jeppu - DAAD Wise Scholar (Interned in Germany) and Mathworks.
2. Ananda Rao - CSE Topper and interned at IIT Bombay and Google Hyderabad.
3. Mohit Reddy - Interned at Google Zurich.
