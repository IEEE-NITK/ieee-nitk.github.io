# HiPC 2019

It all began with our IEEE project. It was titled "Parallelising Graph
Coloring for GPUs" and we wrote a CUDA program for graph coloring on
NVIDIA GPUs. We improved on this by remotely collaborating with
Sreepathi Pai, Professor at University of Rochester, NY  during our
summer holidays. We got to work with better tools and frameworks specific
to implementing parallel graph algorithms. The collaboration led to
novel technique called "Hybridization", which is explained in our paper
titled "[A Hybrid Graph Coloring Algorithm for
GPUs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01478)". 

The above paper was accepted in the [12th HiPC Student Research
Symposium](https://hipc.org/students-research-symposium/).

## Experience

The conference was held at HICC (Hyderabad International Convention
Centre) and went for 4 days. 

On the first and second day, we presented a poster summarizing our work.
We got to present our work to several people from academia and industry
as well..

We were able to attend the presentations of the other accepted papers at
the conference and we got to see industry demos and exhibits from
companies like Intel, AMD and Shell. We also got to attend Tech sessions
from Shell and AMD, which were thought-provoking.

The food was amazing :p.

## Epilogue

It was an enriching experience and a good oppurtunity to learn about the
recent ongoings in the field. It would be good to do your homework based
on the outline of the program before attending the conference to make
utmost use of it.
