                <p>
                    IEEE SIGHT caters to the guiding philosophy of IEEE - ‘Advancing Technology for Humanity’.
                </p>
                <p>
                    IEEE Special Interest Group on Humanitarian Technology (SIGHT) provides IEEE members with 
                    the opportunity to work with a large network of volunteers around the world carrying 
                    out and/or supporting impactful humanitarian activities on the local level. IEEE SIGHT focuses 
                    on sustainable solutions that make a long-term difference in the lives of people. SIGHT 
                    operates through local volunteers and partners working with local communities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We focus on taking up projects in the open-source platforms. 
                    This helps us drive down the cost of the final product and make the solution affordable 
                    to a large section of people.

                    <p>To build a simulation where the movement of the patient is sensed 
                        using a depth sensing camera and will be fed as input for the game 
                        that will be designed. The game will be designed such that it will 
                        gauge the reflexes of the patient and thus will assign scores 
                        according to his or her performance in the said game.
