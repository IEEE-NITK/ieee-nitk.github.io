    "description": "Hacktoberfest NITK aimed to generate awareness of Hacktoberfest by Digital Ocean, a global month-long event that promotes Open Source culture. The NITK Meet-up consisted of a talk from Dr. Mohit P Tahiliani about Open Source fundamentals, and how to start contributing as an inexperienced or a veteran developer. A few students gave the audience a peek into Git/Github and how version control works, also providing them with the resources to get started. The IEEE team also set up a repository on GitHub for the juniors to get acquainted with how Pull Requests, issues and commits work.",
