    "description": "This was a hands-on workshop conducted by Dr Rupesh Nasre from IIT Madras. After the initial introduction, Dr Nasre took over and proceeded with the workshop which involved a mix of theory and practical coding. The workshop progressed in an ascending manner, with concepts getting increasingly complicated. This was followed by some exercises and a small section on the application of GPUs. After CUDA, graph algorithms were introduced to the participants and how GPU programming can be helped to solve those problems.",
