<h2 id="why-signal-processing-why-not-core-electrical-what-fascinated-you-take-up-sp">Why signal processing? Why not core electrical? What fascinated you take up SP?</h2>

<p>Honestly, in the beginningÂ of myÂ secondÂ year, I just decided to choose a topic and go deep into it so that it will help me fetch an internship easily. Having a few projects related to music processing in mind, I decided to learn more about Signal Processing. With the recent boom in Machine Learning applicationsÂ in SP, I realizedÂ that there were a lot of problemÂ statements which could be taken up even at the B.Tech level.</p>

<p>Having developed this interest in SP, I decided to invest all my time into it so that by the end of my B.Tech I would have done some considerable demonstrable work. Hence, I couldnâ€™t take up projects related to core electrical. But hopefully, I can put my basic electrical knowledge to use sometime in the future.</p>

<h2 id="describe-your-interest-in-literature-on-what-kind-of-topics-do-you-write-your-articles-generally">Describe your interest in literature. On what kind of topics do you write your articles generally?</h2>
<p>I like reading political thrillers and detective fictions like the ones by Jeffrey Archer, Dan Brown. I have to admit I like books with cheesy lines which I tend to use in my daily life. I like authors with a perspectiveÂ of looking at the brighter side of everything.</p>

<p>If I find answers to some questions which have been bothering me for a long time, I try to share it in the form of poems or articles. Maybe, I can just be termed as a â€˜Wannabe Writerâ€™</p>

<h2 id="any-advice-to-juniors-regarding-pointer">Any advice to juniors regarding pointer?</h2>

<p>I certainly canâ€™t tell you how to get high pointer, because I have still not figured it out myself.Pointer sadly is still a primary selection criterion in many places.</p>

<p>So, it is important to have a decently high pointer so that you get past the first stage of selection and your resume is read! Â </p>

<h2 id="how-to-manage-time-effectively-how-much-to-devote-to-academics-how-much-to-extracurricular-and-how-much-to-projects">How to manage time effectively (how much to devote to academics, how much to extracurricular and how much to projects)?</h2>

<p>I think Time is a stretchable entity and whether you can fit something into your schedule or not, depends on how desperately you want to finish it.Â 
Each one of us would have set different goals for ourselves, which demands a different style of working. So we haveÂ to get our priorities right and adjust ourÂ time accordingly. In my case, I gave equal importance for coursework and projects.</p>

<h2 id="how-was-your-internship-experience-in-canada">How was your internship experience in Canada?Â </h2>

<p>The most important thing I learnt was to live independently!Â 
I also realizedÂ that I have to develop a lot of new skills and keep updating myself to sustain in the practical technical environment.</p>

<h2 id="do-you-regret-about-your-action-related-to-anything-in-nitk-if-yes-what-do-you-want-to-suggest-your-juniors-so-that-they-dont-regret-in-a-similar-way">Do you regret about your action related to anything in NITK? If yes, what do you want to suggest your juniors so that they donâ€™t regret in a similar way?</h2>

<p>I regret not participating in many of the cultural activities in the college. I got lost in my daily routine. But as an SP student, I convince myself that things always come with a trade-off!Â 
Academically, I used to do projects alone with only a little help from the seniors. It was only by the end of the third year I realized that you can take projects to completion only if you have a good team. I wish I had built a team much earlier so that I could have done much more work.</p>
