<p>Bell Helicopter-Textron India Private Limited (TIPL). <br />
The company visited the campus for the first time and were looking for people for their newly formed Team Innovation-an extended part of the companyâ€™s R&amp;D. As aerospace engineering is a highly interesting field for me, I applied for the intern offer.</p>

<h3 id="was-it-through-the-college-or-off-campus-or-through-a-seniorprof-or-through-an-internship-website">Was it through the college or off-campus or through a senior/prof or through an internship website?</h3>

<p>The company visited the campus in the odd semester. There was an online test in the beginning based on which a few of us were shortlisted. Based on the Technical &amp; HR interview, 3 people were selected.</p>

<h2 id="what-was-your-internship-about">What was your internship about?</h2>

<p>As a materials engineer, my project was broadly titled as - Future Materials Research. It involved a lot of learning on how an aircraft works, how itâ€™s manufactured, aerodynamics, electrical aspects and materials selection. Based on these, I had to work on novel materials for future helicopters.</p>

<h2 id="how-was-the-work-culture">How was the work culture?</h2>

<p>The working environment is very relaxed and healthy. The office timings were 9am-6pm, but the interns were relieved from strictly following it. It is definitely a target-based approach.</p>

<h3 id="was-it-challenging-for-you-to-do-it-what-new-skills-did-you-develop">Was it challenging for you to do it? What new skills did you develop?</h3>

<p>The internship helped me widen my knowledge base to a very large extent. I have a sound understanding about the aircraft working, primarily on the materials side.</p>

<p>The outcome of our Research was on the new technologies for future aircrafts. During the internship, we came up with a lot of novel ideas which are eligible for future patents.</p>

<h2 id="tell-us-about-the-fun-interesting-incidents-during-the-course-of-your-internship">Tell us about the fun/ interesting incidents during the course of your internship.</h2>

<p>I had a study tour to Dynamatic Technologies Limited (DTL) where composite cabins were being manufactured for Bell Helicopter. There were a lot of active activity clubs like Toastmasters Club, Sports Committee, Food Committee etc. The company served cuisines of different parts of the country at a subsidized rate.</p>

<h2 id="what-advice-would-you-give-to-juniors-regarding-your-internship">What advice would you give to juniors regarding your internship?</h2>
<h3 id="would-you-recommend-a-junior-undergoing-a-similar-internship-at-the-same-place-you-went">Would you recommend a junior undergoing a similar internship at the same place you went?</h3>

<p>Definitely. If you are looking for an industrial R&amp;D in the aerospace and aviation sector, this is a place you would love to work in.</p>
