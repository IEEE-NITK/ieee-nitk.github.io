<p><img src="/blog/assets/img/5G-blessing-or-curse/5G.jpg" alt="5G" /></p>

<p>Let us start with what 5G means. 5G is the aberration of the fifth generation of communication networks that would replace 4GLTE due to the prominence that IoT is going to get in the near future. It is designed to increase speed, reduce latency, and improve the flexibility of wireless services. 5G will redefine a broad range of industries with connected services from retail to education, transportation to entertainment, and everything in between. The adoption of 5G technology is as transformative as the automobile and electricity.</p>

<h3 id="1millimeter-waves">1)Millimeter waves</h3>
<p>For 4G network, the frequency spectrum ranging from 2GHz-6GHz is used. But the number of devices using this spectrum is increasing at a high rate. This causes congestion and thus the speed of data transmission is reducing. So millimetre waves of frequency 30GHz-300GHz will be used for 5G data transmission. The speeds achieved by these millimetre waves are high. On the other side, though the transmission is very fast, attenuation is higher when transmitted to greater distances and these waves can not penetrate through trees, buildings or large structures. So to achieve a direct line-of-propagation we use smaller cells.</p>

<h3 id="2small-cells">2)Small Cells</h3>
<p>Instead of using a single high power antenna we use multiple smaller base stations. This method reduces the probability of attenuation through some physical elements and even eliminates the drawback of millimetre waves of not been able to transmit the signals to greater distances. Frequency reusability can be achieved very easily when we use such smaller cells.</p>

<h3 id="3massive-mimo-and-3d-beamforming">3)Massive MIMO and 3D Beamforming</h3>
<p>There might occur situations when connections are required to be more concentrated in one place. This is where Massive MIMO(Multiple Input Multiple Output) and 3D Beamforming helps. With massive MIMO technology, the number of antennas in a tower can be increased up to a theoretical maximum of 256 nodes and 3D beamforming technology helps to transmit waves in multiple directions thereby reducing interference.</p>

<h3 id="4full-duplex-capabilities">4)Full Duplex capabilities</h3>
<p>Wireless providers don‚Äôt actually use full-duplex transceivers. Past systems that supported full-duplex communications had to separate frequency channels to allow 2 users to communicate at the same time without having to take turns transmitting and receiving. But in a 5G network, the use of full-duplex will allow data to be transmitted and received on base station transceivers at the same time using the same frequency.</p>

<h3 id="5network-slicing">5)Network Slicing</h3>
<p>Network slicing is a way of creating separate wireless networks on the cloud allowing users to create personalised internet experience</p>

<h2 id="advantages-of-5g">Advantages of 5G</h2>

<h3 id="1speed">1)Speed</h3>
<p>Data rates of about 10 Gbps or higher can be achieved. Users will have a better experience and the download and upload speeds will be higher.</p>

<h3 id="2reduced-latency">2)Reduced latency</h3>
<p>5G milli-metre wave can achieve latency rate of less than 1 millisecond, which will lead to immediate connection establishment</p>

<h3 id="3unified-platform">3)Unified platform</h3>
<p>It is possible to provide a uniform, consistent and uninterrupted, connectivity across the world.</p>

<h3 id="4personalised-internet">4)Personalised Internet</h3>
<p>There can be a requirement for proving increased internet capacity as there can be a massive flood of people using the internet. With 5G Internet Service Providers can pay for increased bandwidth thereby improving people‚Äôs online experience.</p>

<h2 id="disadvantages-of-5g">Disadvantages of 5G</h2>

<h3 id="1infrastructural-hurdles">1)Infrastructural hurdles</h3>
<p>The infrastructure needed for 5G is far more costly and difficult to install.It would require new towers supporting massive MIMO,additional base stations and new devices supporting 5G technology.This process is going to be slow and will be introduced heterogeneously acreoss different regions because of the different regulatons existing in every region.</p>

<h3 id="2cost">2)Cost</h3>
<p>The types of equipment required for 5G are costly and requires skilled engineers to install and maintain a 5G network. This increases the cost of 5G deployment and maintenance phases</p>

<h3 id="3less-coverage">3)Less Coverage</h3>
<p>Increased bandwidth will mean less coverage. More cell towers will be required to produce this immense bandwidth because the cells are not able to cover as much space as a 3G or 4G cell. Because more cells will need to be rolled out, 5G users should expect that their coverage may not be as widespread at first.</p>

<h2 id="is-5g-dangerous">Is 5G dangerous?</h2>
<p>Although 5G may improve our day to day lives, some consumers have voiced concern about potential health hazards. Many of these concerns are over 5G‚Äôs use of higher energy millimetre-wave radiation.</p>

<p>There are two types of radiation:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ionising Radiation</li>
  <li>Non-Ionising Radiation</li>
</ul>

<p>The major difference between the two is that ionizing radiation is dangerous because it can break chemical bonds. Ionizing radiation is the reason we wear sunscreen outside because short-wavelength ultraviolet light from the sky has enough energy to knock electrons from their atoms, damaging skin cells and DNA. Millimetre waves, on the other hand, are non-ionizing because they have longer wavelengths and not enough energy to damage cells directly. The only established hazard of non-ionizing radiation is too much heating. At high exposure levels, radio frequency (RF) energy can indeed be hazardous, producing burns or other thermal damage, but these exposures are typically incurred only in occupational settings near high-powered radio frequency transmitters, or sometimes in medical procedures gone wrong. Many of the public‚Äôs outcries over the adoption of 5G echo concerns over previous generations of cellular technology. Sceptics believe exposure to non-ionizing radiation may still be responsible for a range of illnesses, from brain tumours to chronic headaches. Over the years, there have been thousands of studies investigating these concerns.
In 2018, the National Toxicology Program released a decade-long study that found some evidence of an increase in brain and adrenal gland tumours in male rats exposed to the RF radiation emitted by 2G and 3G cellphones, but not in mice or female rats. The animals were exposed to levels of radiation four times higher than the maximum level permitted for human exposure so this study can not conclude that the RF radiation emitted by 5G is harmful to humans. Many scientists agree that we need more studies on the potential health effects of 5G networks. For the advocates of 5G, many believe the benefits 5G can provide to society far outweigh the unknowns.</p>

<p>Harish Krishnaswamy, an associate professor of electrical engineering at Columbia University in New York says</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúI think 5G will have a transformational impact on our lives and enable fundamentally new things. 
What those types of applications will be and what that impact is, we can‚Äôt say for sure right now. 
It could be something that takes us by surprise and changes something for society. If history has 
taught us anything, then 5G will be another example of what wireless can do for us.‚Äù</p>
