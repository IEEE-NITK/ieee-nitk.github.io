<p><strong>Regenerative Braking</strong> is an energy recovery mechanism which slows a vehicle or object by converting its kinetic energy into a form which can be either be used immediately or stored until needed. We have implemented this RBS in bicycles for generating electricity which can be used for different purposes like charging phones. For this we constructed a circuit to convert Mechanical energy to Electrical energy.</p>

<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>

<p>RBS is based on the principle of electromagnetic induction. On the application of brakes, the gears on the brakes come in contact with the rim of the wheel. These gears are connected to a DC Dynamo. This dynamo converts mechanical energy to electrical energy which can be used directly or stored in a battery. We have used this energy directly to charge a phone.</p>

<p>RBS project was under the supervision of assigned mentors Anand Pathak and Ayush Srivastava. Anand Pathak mentored the project by providing insights on the Mechanical structure and Casing. Ayush Srivastava mentored the design and building the electronic circuit. RBS was implemented under the ENVISION initiative by IEEE which funded for the same and assigned mentors who were IEEE Executive members.</p>

<h2 id="why-should-such-activities-be-undertaken">Why should such activities be undertaken?</h2>

<p>RBS is one of those projects which does not require digital analysis, software simulation, high level technical knowledge and experience. Taking up such projects in the first year improves technical knowledge and experience, develops team spirit and management skills.</p>
