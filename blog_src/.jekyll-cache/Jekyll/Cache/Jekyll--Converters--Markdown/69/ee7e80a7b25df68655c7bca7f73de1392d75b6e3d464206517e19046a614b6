<h2 id="how-does-augmented-reality-work">How does Augmented Reality work?</h2>

<p>In most augmented reality applications, a user will see both synthetic and natural light. This is done by overlaying projected images on top of a pair of see-through goggles or glasses, which allow the images and <strong>interactive virtual objects</strong> to layer on top of the user‚Äôs view of the real world.
For augmented reality to work you need camera,accelerometer,rotation sensor and some math skills and GPS. Idea behind all of this is to use data from real word, data gathered by the sensors, and process it in the way computer can use.</p>
