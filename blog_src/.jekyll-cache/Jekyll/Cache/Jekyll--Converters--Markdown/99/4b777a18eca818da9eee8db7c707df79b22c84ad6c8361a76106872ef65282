<p>This is where <strong>SEO i.e. Search Engine Optimisation</strong> comes into play.</p>

<p>In a world where <strong>over 90% of online experiences start with a search engine,</strong> showing up on the front page of Google Search can be the deciding factor for a business’ growth.</p>

<h3 id="what-does-seo-mean-">What does SEO mean ?</h3>
<p>Quite simply, SEO is the term used for all the steps that can be used  to ensure the visibility of your website and its content on search engine results pages (SERPs). Visibility here means how high it appears in the SERP in the <strong>Organic Results</strong> i.e. the naturally appearing results, not the paid sections.</p>

<p>The methods vary from technical practices you can use behind the scenes on your website (on-page SE) to all the promotional (off-page SEO) approaches you can use to raise your site’s visibility (link-building, social media marketing).</p>

<p>Here’s a short video that will give you a clear picture about SEO.</p>

<h3 id="what-do-search-engines-look-for-">What do Search Engines look for ?</h3>

<p>1) How <strong>Relevant</strong> is the page w.r.t the user’s search. Search Engines makes use of the keywords , user location , history, time period and many other factors to show the user results which is accurate and relevant.</p>

<p>2) <strong>Content Quality</strong> is as important as the keywords. Websites publishing regular, fresh and helpful articles and videos are usually ranked higher.</p>

<p>3) <strong>User Experience</strong> : Webpage should be easily navigable, should have internal linkings and should be searchable.</p>

<p>4) It should be optimised to take less <strong>Time to Load</strong>.
Check out this <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/">Google tool</a> for checking your website’s speed and fixes to make it faster.</p>

<p>5) Webpage should be <strong>Responsive</strong>. Sites optimised for cross-device compatibility will have a higher rating.

<p>6) The website should be <strong>Trustworthy</strong>. Proper certified websites are always preferred.</p>

<p>7) Webpage having more <strong>Backlinks</strong> from popular websites rank higher. SE’s give more weight to backlinks from trustworthy and popular sites to avoid bogus linkings.</p>

<p>8) <strong>Title</strong> and <strong>Meta</strong> tags matter. These are used by Search Engines to filter out results.</p>

<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;html&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;head&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;title&gt;</span>Baseball Cards - Buy Cards, Baseball News, Card Prices<span class="nt">&lt;/title&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;meta</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">"description"</span> <span class="na">content=</span><span class="s">"Brandon's Baseball Cards provides a
 large selection of vintage and  modern cards for sale.  We also offer 
 daily baseball news and events in"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/head&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/html&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/img/SEO/titlemeta.png" alt="Tags" /></p>

<p>Use separate description meta tags for each page.</p>

<p>9) HTML tags used should have the required attributes (e.g alt attribute in img tag).</p>

<p>10) <strong>Simple to understand URL’s</strong> is another plus.</p>

<p>11) <strong>Simple website directory</strong> makes it easier for GoogleBots to crawl your website.</p>

<p>SEO is no longer an option in today’s crowded online world.
Today, making it to the first page of Google Search has become the deciding factor for a website’s success.</p>
