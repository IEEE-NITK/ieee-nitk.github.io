<p><img src="/blog/assets/img/social-engineering/2.jpg" alt="phishing" /></p>

<p>Phishing is the fraudulent attempt to obtain sensitive information such as usernames, passwords and credit card details by disguising as a trustworthy entity. This mainly uses disguised email or fake website as a weapon.The main goal of this attack is to trick the email recipient into believing that the message is something they want or need for instance a request from their bank to reset their password or a note from someone in their company asking them to download a file infected with malware. It‚Äôs one of the oldest types of attacks, dating back to the 1990s, and it‚Äôs still one of the most widespread and techniques becoming increasingly sophisticated day by day. It mainly aims to get your personal information.
It works on the principle that if you cast a large enough net, you are sure to catch a fish.
The mail is sent to you may contain:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Request information</li>
  <li>Download infected files</li>
  <li>May ask you to visit a compromised site</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2-pretexting">2. Pretexting</h4>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/img/social-engineering/3.jpg" alt="pretexting" /></p>

<p>A fictional situation is created for the purpose of obtaining personal and sensitive information from an unsuspecting individual. It usually involves researching a target and making use of his data for impersonation or manipulation. An important aspect of pretexting is establishing a target‚Äôs trust.
Attackers can impersonate co-workers, police officers, bankers, tax authorities, insurance investigators, etc. A simpler way to put is that anyone who can be perceived as having right-to-know the information by the target. The attacker only needs to prepare answers to questions that might be asked by the target. Most of the times, an authoritative voice, an earnest tone, and an ability to think on one‚Äôs feet are all that is needed to create a pretextual scenario.</p>

<h4 id="3-baiting">3. Baiting</h4>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/img/social-engineering/4.jpg" alt="baiting" /></p>

<p>As you guys might have guessed, it‚Äôs the act of promising something good in return of some action or information. Attackers may offer users free music or movie or game downloads, if you give them login credentials to a certain site. Attackers can also focus on exploiting human curiosity via the use of physical media.</p>

<p>Now let‚Äôs see how this attack can be done?
Let‚Äôs take an industrial scenario ‚Äì with the end goal of infiltrating a company‚Äôs network, the attacker may distribute flash drives infected with malware to employees, hoping that the hardware will be inserted into network-connected systems as the means to spread malicious code. Perhaps the innocent-looking devices are in a basket of freebies placed in the company lobby. These devices can be placed strategically so a targeted person will take the bait. The devices may be marked with intriguing labels link ‚ÄúConfidential‚Äù or ‚ÄúSalary‚Äù to tempt the people to open the files. The employ may take the bait and insert the device into the system connected to the network and Voil√† !</p>

<h4 id="4-quid-pro-quo">4. Quid Pro Quo</h4>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/img/social-engineering/7.PNG" alt="quid-pro-quo" /></p>

<p>Quid Pro Quo Attacks promise a benefit in exchange for information. The benefit usually assumes as a form of service, baiting usually takes the form of a good.It can be considered as a request for your information in exchange for some compensation. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is quid pro quo‚Ä¶</p>

<h4 id="5-tailgating">5. Tailgating</h4>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/img/social-engineering/5.jpg" alt="tailgating" /></p>

<p>Entering a building directly behind someone who has used their identity for access.It takes advantage of the people being courteous. For example: A person impersonates a delivery driver and waits outside a building. When an employee gains security‚Äôs approval and opens their door, the attacker asks that the employee ‚Äòhold the door‚Äô, thereby gaining access through someone who is authorized to enter the company</p>
