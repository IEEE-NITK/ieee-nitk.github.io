I"J<p>I don’t know what kind of fascination it is, probably parents sermon their little ones or the Indian school teachers are rather pedagogues, but this one notion of securing admission for undergraduation in a leading institute with specialisation in computer science is considered to be victory. I too was once a prey to this concept. The D-day shattered my dreams and landed me to choose one among the core branches. Hence, by elimination, the same technique one might use in the exams (xD), I chose chemical.</p>

<p><strong>Preliminary thoughts:</strong> Chemical engineering = Chemistry. Bury myself. Very disinclined to the idea of studying chemistry, infact chemistry is despicable.</p>

<p><strong>Society:</strong> People are incorrigible, my neighbour even blurted it out unconscionably – “Somehow try to get a branch change to ECE, not much future in chemical you see.” 
 “Why did you choose chemical of all branches?”
“Oh mechanical? Not for girls, good that you chose chemical.”</p>

<p>Now that I’ve chosen my branch turned a deaf ear to people’s prophecies.</p>

<p><strong>The present:</strong> Absolutely no regrets.</p>

<p>Chemical engineering infact is a convergence of physics and mathematics. Chemistry is just the basis. A graduate might perform groundbreaking scientific research, work as a field engineer, or occupy a senior management position. Graduates employed by multinational companies often travel all over the world.</p>

<p>One aspect that dissuades students is the salary package one receives soon after graduation. One might argue, but salary is a concern. Frankly, I too had similar thoughts. But let me set it right, a chemical engineer requires specific, additional long periods of tireful training pertaining to the needs and type of the company. During the probation periods, one is paid and is also given privilege to a number of benefits, let alone the safety and risk management steps the company considers for you. Hence the difference. As you progress, your pay-scale shoots, probably in 5-10 years of experience.</p>

<p>Even those graduates who choose not to accept jobs in industry are highly employable in other areas because they are experienced at solving problems and have good analytical and management skills. Chemical engineering graduates can go on to successful careers in finance, consultancy or scientific journalism, to name but a few.</p>

<p>Chemical engineers work to improve the quality of people’s lives. Most items used by people everyday have needed chemical engineers to produce them. Chemical engineers are helping to end starvation, disease and poverty. They are working to save the environment by developing alternative technologies to combat acid rain, lead pollution and the greenhouse effect.</p>

<p>Chemical also offers a wide range of areas for specialization. Nanotechnology, petrochemicals, material sciences, colloidal and polymer science, agricultural production, biotechnology, catalysis, electro-mechanical systems, energy, kinetics, modelling and simulation, instrumentation, industrial safety and pollution control, environment, chemical process and plant design, manufacturing………</p>

<h3 id="chemical-engineering-nitk">Chemical engineering @NITK</h3>

<p>The topmost institute for undergraduate studies in chemical engineering among NITs and in the <strong>top fifteen in India</strong>. These are just the statistics picked up from the internet, what’s more vital is the holistic development as a student as well as expertise in the subject. A well balanced curriculum having both theory and practice, well qualified and friendly faculty have been the hall mark of the department right from its inception. Every faculty will know you inside-out in just one semester! They give good suggestions and always encourage you for your betterment.</p>

<p>I opine, given the experience of professors on-site and off-site, their concern towards every student, beyond any doubt should be one of the unparalled options.</p>

<p>A considerable amount of PSUs along with private companies do come to pick up eligible students on campus. Over and above, one also has an innumerable opportunities for higher studies in India and abroad. Though these programs are common across other branches as well, the most exhilarating facet is live experimentation and multifaceted instrumentation.</p>

<p>Recently, I had been working on self healing materials, as a replacement for muscles in the human body, and for two days I just saw myself enthralled with cutting the material and joining it back again using different crosslinkers. (xD), and it’s not that I have lost my touch with computer science (I once craved for), I model it by coding. See, it’s MULTIFACETED.</p>

<p>Ping me for any thoughts and doubts!</p>
