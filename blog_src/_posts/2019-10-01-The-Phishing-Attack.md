## What is Phishing
Phishing is a type of cyber attack.Phishing is a cybercrime in which a target or targets are contacted by email, telephone or text message by someone posing as a legitimate institution to lure individuals into providing sensitive data such as personally identifiable information, banking and credit card details, and passwords.Phishing is a type of social engineering attack.Phishing has been one of the fastest evolution in the hacking history. Different types of phishing attacks spread over the internet in a flash. Here is how it evolved and different types in it.

## Types of Phishing attacks

1. Email Spoofing – Name Impersonation
Email spoofing is one of the easiest types of phishing.It can be done in many ways.
	a.Sending an email through a familiar username.
	b.Sending an email through identity(email) of an organisation.
Compared to other types of phishing attacks, email spoofing has a focused target.
How to prevent email phishing?
The best way to prevent these attacks is by carefully reading the sender’s email address. Do not open any link in any email if yur are not sure if it came from a trusted source.

2. URL Phishing
In URL phishing attacks, Hackers use the phishing page’s URL to infect the target.
This has a higher opening rate because people click on links sent by strangers or people they know,
They are ready to accept friend requests and messages.click links and few people are even ready to share their email and contact details.
Hidden link
One way to hook a person with a phishing bait is by using a hidden link. We have all received emails with the action phrase click here or download now or subscribe or confirm your email. 
These are examples of hidden links, which makes it easier for scammers to launch phishing attacks.
Eg:a.Instead of url if the hacker uses hidden link like this, It would be difficult to know about     	   phising <click here>.
   b.Hackers can also use url shortners to shorten an url which makes it difficult to identify 	    	 phishing.
How to prevent URL phishing? 
Hover the cursor over the attached link. The full link will appear on the laptop screen. If the link is different or seems phishy, don’t click on it. In case of mobile devices, press and hold over the link, and the attached link will appear as a pop-up window with options on which action can be taken.

3. Pop-Up Messages: 
Pop-up messages are the easiest way to run a successful phishing attack.Through pop-up messages, attackers get a window to steal the login credentials by redirecting them to a fake website.This technique of phishing is also known as In-session phishing.
How to prevent in-session phishing?
The only prevention we have at present is the pop-up blockers available in the browser extension and changing settings. If your data is very crucial, you should opt for a security software that blocks all these threats in one shot to prevent any kind of data security breach.

4. Website Spoofing
Website spoofing is similar to email spoofing, though it is different from email spoofing.
How is website spoofing done?
Phishers publish a website by copying the design, content, and user interface of website which he wanted to phish.Some scammers also use URL shortening tools to create a similar URL for the fake sites. This is done, beacause a shortened fake url is tough to decide Phishing. 
How to prevent Website Spoofing attacks?
a. The attacker designs the phishing page in such a way that it ggets redirected to original page. So whenever you feel that it's a phishing page enter wrong details and submit them. Then you will be redirected to original page, Then enter your correct details.
b.Third party tools like SysCloud’s Phishing Protection provide the best possible security from all kinds of spoofing attacks. As a part of their service, all the suspicious websites are not only blocked but also reported to the user.

5. Cross-site Scripting(xss)
Cross-site scripting (XSS) or scripting uses malicious scripts deployed on the victim’s computer or phone using emails as the medium.As most of the web pages are scripted using JavaScript, it becomes easier for hackers to launch a scripting attack.Hackers infect the script of a legitimate website – which you visit regularly, which can be identified through social engineering, with a script that will redirect you to a phishing page.When the browser loads the phishing page, it will execute the malicious script, and the attack would take place without the victim’s knowledge. 
Here is how a normal script works when you search for ‘colors’ on Google.
How to prevent cross-site scripting attack?
a.Use browsers with in-built XSS protection feature.
b.Disable allowing sites to run javaScript.
c.Check for the latest version of browsers and security applications.
d.Use a browser add-ons like “NoScript,” which let you choose whether to allow or deny the scripting permissions
6. Man-in-the-Middle Attack
In Man-in-the-Middle or MITM attack, a malicious actor intercepts online interaction between two parties.Hackers impersonate themselves on both sides to access confidential information like transactions, conversations, or other data. 
MITM use two major spoofing execution techniques: ARP spoofing and DNS spoofing.
ARP spoofing: ARP spoofing is an attack in which a malicious actor sends a fake ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) message over a local area network. This links the attacker’s MAC (Machine address) address to the IP address of a legitimate computer or server on the network.
DNS spoofing: Domain Name System (DNS) spoofing or DNS Cache Poisoning is a form of hacking that corrupts the DNS data in the resolver cache, causing the name server to return incorrect result records. DNS spoofing can be done with a tool called as Ettercap.
How to prevent MiTM phishing attacks?
The only way to prevent the Man-in-the-Middle attack is by encrypting your online data. Using S/MIME encryption can help you to secure the data from misuse by cybercrooks, or you can use Third-party tools to encrypt your data.
