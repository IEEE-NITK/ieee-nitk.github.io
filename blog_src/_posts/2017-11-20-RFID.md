RFID technology has been in circulation for many years now. You may have
encountered it first-hand while borrowing library books, or while
swiping for attendance in school. Recently, the government issued RFID
chips to be installed in cars so that we can zoom through toll booths
instead of waiting in long queues. RFID technology has also got a fair
share of screen time. Remember Casino Royale? Her Majesty's Secret
Service injects Bond with a glass-enclosed, rice-sized RFID chip, so
that, in M’s words, “they'll know where he is”. Here is a little insight
into the technology that is taking the world by storm.

What is RFID?
=============

Radio-frequency Identification is an Automated Data Collection (ADC)
technology that uses radio-frequency waves to transfer data between a
reader and an object with an RFID chip. It is used to track, categorise,
and uniquely identify objects. The main advantage of RFID over other ADC
technologies like barcode, Optical Character Readers etc., is that the
object need not be in the line of sight of the reader. It uses tags
which act as labels for the object to be identified. Tags generally have
an integrated circuit for processing and storing information that
modulates and demodulates the RF signals and antenna for receiving and
transmitting the signals. Passive tags have a device that collects dc
power from the reader. Active tags are powered by a locally connected
battery, and have a much longer read range than passive tags. The
reader, or interrogator, is a two-way radio transmitter-receiver which
sends signals to the tags and reads their response.

Real World Applications of RFID:
================================

1.  Supply Chain Management, Manufacturing and Processing industry: RFID
    is used to take inventory and track manufactured products, tools and
    other assets.

2.  Race Timing: Timing marathons and races are one of the most popular
    uses of RFID. The runners wear tags which are read by readers placed
    alongside the tracks. This is a huge advantage while timing
    marathons and other races with a large number of participants
    because participants don’t need to start as batch.

3.  Access Control: Certain areas require a higher level of security.
    From doors to parking lots, [RFID access control
    tags](http://www.atlasrfidstore.com/access-control-rfid-tag-sample-pack-uhf-passive/) restrict
    access to only those pre-approved.

4.  Library systems: RFID tagged books improve the efficacy of the
    borrowing process. While barcodes require line of sight, RFID tags
    can be read from multiple angles which means the checkout and
    check-in process is significantly faster. Also, taking inventory of
    books on the shelf is dramatically faster.

5.  Smart Groceries: RFID Tags are added to all grocery items. While
    leaving the store, the customer walks through an RFID interrogator
    which rings up the items in the cart. This greatly reduces the
    checkout wait time.

6.  Smart Fridges: By recognising what is being put in and what is being
    taken out, smart fridges can make their own shopping lists and can
    even suggest recipes based on what is present in the fridge.

Likewise, RFID can be used to make several things “smart” such as smart
currency, for anti-counterfeiting and tracking, or smart airline tickets
which indicate the location of the airport. In recent years, with the
advent of the Internet of Things, the scope of RFID technology has
increased by manifolds. However, as it is with most new, disruptive
technologies, it can be abused in ways that have generated breach of
privacy concerns, as tags can easily be used to track people instead of
just objects. But if used smartly, this technology can go a long way in
making the world around us smarter.
