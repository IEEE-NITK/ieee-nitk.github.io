**1.Bionics and its growing relevance**
The rise of bionics has prompted some interesting questions- **Can we trade
away our biological body for a repairable one , one that won’t age?**.
Bionics is defined as the science of connecting biological systems to artificial
systems to develop machines that can imitate our biology.
As bionic systems and transhuman augmentations exceed human capabilities
humanity might soon face an interesting dichotomy - **Either remain physically
inferior and embody the cherished values of humanism** as we know them or
to become a **superior transhuman with a repairable body that can
transcend the decay of aging**. If you choose the latter it will involve switching
out almost every part of your body with prosthetics that could do the job equally
as well.
The time to make this decision might be sooner than you think as many of our
natural apparatuses are finally becoming replaceable with bionics such as ur
hearing, our sight and even some simpler parts of our brain.



**2.The Brain Computer Interface**

There exists a repetition and rhythm in the neural activity, which is distinguished
by the frequencies of the brain waves that have several classes such as infra
low waves, delta waves , theta waves , alpha waves , beta waves and gamma
waves.
BCIs(Brain Computer Interfaces) provide ease and comfort by controlling
machines through brain signals. They are made by integrating brain signals to
arrange brain potentials in a way so that no muscle arbitration is required. The
intrusive approach of placing electrodes inside the scalp is cumbersome as
compared to the non-invasive approach in which electrodes are placed on the
scalp, which is used in many BCI based applications.

In general, BCI systems are divided into four phases

● acquisition of data
● preprocessing the acquired data
● extracting features
● classification**.**

Let’s explore the 4 phases taking the example of a BCI based robotic arm

**A. EEG Data Acquisition**

In the first step, data is acquired by an experiment conducted to control the robotic
arm using EEG signals.
During the experiment, a video instructing to perform clench, rest, and attention by
showing mind focusing games are shown to the participants each with a time
difference of 10 seconds. The video is played on an LED screen and based on
the type of video the subjects are instructed to perform the action as shown for
every 10 seconds. A 20-minutes long data recording for EEG signals is
performed for each subject.
The sampling rate of the acquired signals is 256 Hz and the output of the cognitive
software is sent to the ARDUINO UNO board to control the robotic arm.


The EEG signals acquired through a Muse Headband are then modified, filtered,
digitized, and processed.
Finally, a driving signal is sent to the set of servo motors within the robotic arm to
perform an action of picking and placing a bottle.

**B. Pre-Processing**

The acquired EEG data is stored as floating-point values which are directly
converted from the unsigned 14-bit analog to digital converter output. These
floating-point values cause DC level problem to the signal.
For removal of this DC offset it is required to apply DC offset removal. The
simplest method for the removal of DC offset is to subtract the average value of
the signal from the entire data channel.

**C. Feature Extraction**

After preprocessing phase, the next step is to extract features from the acquired
data. There are two common types of features that can be extracted are
Let S(t) represents the acquired signal, then the features can be calculated as
follows, The maximum amplitude Smax of the signal S(t) is calculated as,
Smax=max{|S(t)|}
The minimum amplitude Smin of the signal S (t) is calculated
Smin=min{|S(t)|}
The absolute amplitude (AAMP) is calculated using,
AAMP=|Smax|
We calculate avg ,Energy and Power of the acquired signal.
To reduce the complexity of the system, another feature named Kurtosis is used


**D. Feature Classification**

For the classification of data, neural networking algorithms are highly efficient. It is
difficult to formulate a perfect algorithmic solution that closely matches the
human neuronal system Machine learning programs can extract relevant signal
in noise presence with low computational complexity and with higher
classification accuracy.



**3.The Next Step in Human Evolution**

The next chapter in Human evolution won’t be biological ,but instead ,
technological.
We as a species must strive to transcend disability through technological
innovation
We shouldn't view disability as being broken- a human being can never be
"broken"
technology is broken/inadequate.
In conclusion , if we want to trade away our biological body for a mechanical
body then bionics would be the key to make this transition possible. We clearly


seem to be having the beginnings of what we could call bionic eyes ,bionic skin
and bionic ears.
It might just be the case that the evolution of technology has come to play a
greater role in guiding our species than our DNA has.If we could harness this
power we could open up a new chapter in the storybook of humanity.2
