### Introduction

Everyone might know what a rover is. It is a space exploration device
designed to move across the surface of celestial bodies. Have you ever
wondered how these rovers are capable of traversing the rough and rocky
terrains of a planet? Different kinds of suspension systems are employed
to help them achieve this task. Rocker-Bogie is one such suspension
system which is very popular and widely used. It is currently NASA’s
favoured design for wheeled mobile rovers. NASA’s Curiosity rover uses
this mechanism.

### Design & Features

The largest link on each side is called rocker. It has two joints: one
connected to the drive wheel and the other connected to the second link
called Bogie. Bogie has drive wheel on each end.

The primary feature of rocker bogie is its simple and reliable design.
It uses no springs or stub axles. It is thus capable of climbing over
obstacles that are upto twice the size of wheel’s diameter. It offers
good stability along its travel by keeping all the six wheels on the
ground.

Each side of suspension moves independently allowing the rover to
traverse terrains where the left and right rockers have to go over
different sizes of obstacles. By proper design, the rover can be made to
sustain tilt upto 50 degrees. Power is given to both front and back
wheels enabling the rover to traverse obstacles without slip.

One major disadvantage is regarding the travel speed of the rover. At
present, the speed is limited to about 10 cm/s to minimize dynamic
shocks and damage upon impact

There is still a lot to study and explore in this field. The design can
be optimized to make it more cost effective and improve its strength and
rigidity. One major concern would be to increase the travel speed so
that it can be utilised to a greater extent.
