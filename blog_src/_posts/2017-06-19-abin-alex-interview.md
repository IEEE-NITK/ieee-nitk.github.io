## Back-Story

Hello guys, today I had a great opportunity to interview Abin Alex. He has done his BTech in Mechanical from NITK. He was an executive member of IEEE and SIGHT Chair in 2015. He is currently a Research Assistant in IISc and is working on stability of systems. With the amount of experience he possesses and the air of intelligence he creates around the person he is interacting with, it was a great opportunity for me.

### What is one thing you want mechanical students to remember?

That question can be answered in two sections. First, academics and then placements. Regarding academics, one important thing that comes into my mind is that our curriculum is inadequete for some higher level understanding of subjects; and we need to take online courses, talk to people, attend lectures and so on. So don't just stick to what you learn in class, apply what you learn by doing projects to get an edge over the others especially when you are applying for an MS programme. The second aspect is on placements. Most mechanical jobs are not actually "mechanical". There might be few companies which do core mechanical jobs but most companies don't. And that is why many choose to go abroad to get an MS. So from that perspective, you need a good CGPA (> 8) to put up an application for a job in India. And for people interested in research or people wanting core mechanical jobs after MS abroad; places like Germany are great; keep your pointer high, above 9.

### Mechanical Engg. being a very broad field, how do we find our area of interest?

I can recall my experience. When I was in first year, I wanted do to aerodyanamics and with that in mind I learnt fluid dynamics, started going deep into it and took a lot of online courses and read Anderson's book on aerodyanamics. But in second year I realised fluid mechanics wasn't for me. I wans't enjoying what I was doing. I started taking more online courses. I took coures in dynamics, robotics and then I felt robotics seemed to be a prospective option and got the quadcopter project in IEEE, where I worked on state estimation. That really helped me learn the practical applications before I went into the theoretical aspects. After that I stepped into dynamics and started going deep into it and online courses helped me there. So for people confused, keep working on what you think is the right thing at that point of time and you'll eventually find what you're interested in.

### How was your experinece in the Quadcopter Team?

My interest towards robotics was kindled by that team. I was made to work on the CAD model of the quadcopter and estimate parameters for the control system. That project really got me interested in dynamics. I started looking into differential equations, started looking into Newtonian method and Lagrangian method and now I am in IISc and it is purely because of that quadcopter project.

### How do we go about inter-disciplinary research?

To start off, this you have to get into research. It is hard, because it is not what the herd does. A lot of my peers took up corporte jobs and that scared me about my choices. Things are valued when there is demand for it. But research is the opposite. While working on a problem, you're the first one there. If there is someone else working on the same problem, you wouldn't work on it. Coming to inter-disciplinary research, we cannot start off with everything. That's the first thing to keep in mind. Start off with something you are good at and go deep into it. As soon as you go deep, you'll see it starts diverging. Be open to expand into other domains and you'll see you'll have stepped into inter-disciplinary research. It is the same for every filed because it has to do with the mathematics which is diverse in itself.

### How is life at IISc? How is it different from NITK?

IISc is great! In NITK there was no rest, we had to work even on weekends. The IISc culture is more relaxed and as long as you publish papers, you're okay! There are no time restrictions. Plus, the environment is great. Everyone is motivated and people will help you out in getting quality research. The best thing is that your work is exposed to the world. As cliche as it may sound, a few days back one of the professors who I mailed told me he read my work. That is the quality of work that is done here. Another thing is the funding here is much simpler. You don't have to do that much administrative work, it is directly under the professor. In short, if you are looking for a good research experinece, IISc is a great place.

### What is your current research interest?

I am currently working on non-linear control. I started working on un-manned aerial vehicle and how it is to be guided to achieve a specific task. It started whilst I was an undergrad, I would come here(IISc) to develop new methods for guidance and got interesting results on some faster methods for UAV convergence. That's where it started and now it has moved to path planning for robots in obstacle environment which is an interesting challenge and a lot of robotiscists are looking at. Currently, I am looking at stability of systems and also stability of societies which is more philosophical!

<sub> That was the end of the interview. </sub>

Abin and us had just the one year of overlap in undergrad, yet managed to share key insights about research that we still use today. The quadcopted his team built won the Student Exemplary Award for the IEEE NITK Student Branch and still funds the club today. If we could only take only one message from Abin, it would be to keep reminding ourselves to take proper rest. Nothing will come in a day, nothing will come when you're tired. Continual work will only drain yourself and you need to charge yourself that often. Results will come, they will come in plenty! All you need is patience.
