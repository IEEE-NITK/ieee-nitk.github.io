Whether you have played “Pokémon Go” or not, you’ve probably at least heard of the game. A special app on your smartphone or tablet makes it look like Pokémon is right there in front of you  while you search for and “capture” the different characters.  This game aquainted the world with this fast growing technology Augmented Reality. This new technology, blurs the line between what's real and what's computer-generated by enhancing what we see, hear, feel and smell.

## How does Augmented Reality work?

In most augmented reality applications, a user will see both synthetic and natural light. This is done by overlaying projected images on top of a pair of see-through goggles or glasses, which allow the images and **interactive virtual objects** to layer on top of the user's view of the real world.
For augmented reality to work you need camera,accelerometer,rotation sensor and some math skills and GPS. Idea behind all of this is to use data from real word, data gathered by the sensors, and process it in the way computer can use.

## Real World Examples of Social Media Apps Using Augmented Reality

## Future of Augmented Reality

AR may completely revamp how we navigate the world, both indoors and outdoors. Imagine seeing directions before you throughout Walmart to find the laundry detergent you were looking for. It can also help eCommerce shoppers try products at home before they purchase. 

In the future, all stores will feature 3D models that can be seen in your very room with a click of a button. See how the lamp you want to buy would look in your living room through AR, or the queen size bed that you don’t think will fit in your bedroom.
