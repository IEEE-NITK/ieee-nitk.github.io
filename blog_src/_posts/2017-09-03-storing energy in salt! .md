## Introduction


Renewable energy is the answer to sustainable development. It is the hot
topic of our generation and even though it is in its rudimentary stage,
it is the best solution in maintaining the balance between environment
and our energy needs. We all know that a lot of research is going on in
this field, whether it is the oft talked about and used solar and wind
energy, or the slightly less used ocean thermal energy.

But, what do you do after you produce this energy? What if it is in
excess to your current need? You need to store it because… Frankly, it
would be a waste of resources otherwise. And this is the need of the
hour.

A lot of this storage is now being done on Lithium ion batteries but
we’re still trying to find new ways to store it which is more efficient,
environment friendly and cost effective as well. One of these methods is
storing energy in molten salt.

## What is the molten salt technology?


Basically, it stores energy in molten salts. Salt at the room
temperature is brought to a higher temperature by heating and hence
converting it into its molten state. The energy is stored as the latent
heat of the salt. This energy being stored can be used as and when
required.

Alphabet’s ‘Project Malta’ have used this concept to store energy from
wind and solar. The set up consists of 4 large, insulated vats, 2
containing salt and the other 2 containing antifreeze. The electrical
energy produced from these sources is used to create 2 separate streams
of hot and cold air. These streams are used to respectively heat the
salt and cool the antifreeze. When we need to use this energy, the 2
reservoirs can be used to produce hot and cold streams of air that leads
to the formation of powerful gusts; this can then be used to run the
turbine. The advantage of this method is that it is non-toxic and
chemically inert.

Solar Reserve also uses the same basic concept. Here, we have a tank
with a salt which is a mixture of sodium and potassium nitrate. The heat
energy from the sources is used to heat up the salt and then it is
maintained at a higher temperature of around 560˚C. To use this energy,
it is sent to a heat exchanger which produces steam at high temperature
and pressure. This is then used to run a turbine.

Apart from this, a lot of research is also going on in this field all
over the world. The University of South Australia recently won the ANSTO
Eureka Prize for Innovative Use of Technology for their ground-breaking
work in this field.
