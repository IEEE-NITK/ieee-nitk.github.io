Git is a distributed version control system. It means Git helps you manage different versions of your work, record the changes and helps different collaborators work parallelly on the same project.

Imagine that you are working on a big project involving many files and folders in it. You make a series of changes to your project and now finally when you compile it, you see the application is crashing or not working as expected. In such a case, Git is the best tool you could use. If you have recorded all your changes uniformly in Git, you can any time refer to those versions. Alternately, you can create a copy of your work at the beginning itself, and start working over it and if the changes work out correctly, you can try to merge them with your original project.

Git Core:
------------

<a name="logicalareas"></a>

In a Git repository/folder, we have three three logical areas, namely:
- Working Tree
- Staging Area
- Commmit History
![Three Logical Areas](/blog_src/assets/img/A-Dive-into-Git_Directory/three_areas_git.png)

For more clarity on commit, consider taking snapshots of your staged changes.

Till now, you might be wondering where is all this information getting stored? A Git repository is initialised with an empty ```.git``` folder which contains information regarding commits, branches, config and many more. Weâ€™ll see a few of these below.

Let's play with Git and try to understand its features:
> Note: I will be using command-line Git. I suggest installing any linux system before proceeding and learning basic bash commands. You can refer [this](https://ieee.nitk.ac.in/blog//installing-ubuntu/) for ubuntu installation and [this](https://medium.com/@zibon/basic-linux-command-lines-to-get-started-developing-in-ubuntu-linux-b54def1c2190) for getting started with basic bash commands.

<a name="example"></a>

Install Git on your system using

`sudo apt-get install git`

Make a new directory `git_test` and initialize it with Git using 

`git init`

It will create `.git` folder.
![Git Init](/blog_src/assets/img/A-Dive-into-Git_Directory/initial_empty_git.png)

Now, we have to configure the `user.name` and `user.email`. Whenever we commit our staged changes, Git includes this name, email and time of commit along with it. This is important to check who made these changes and when.

`git config --global user.name <your-name>`<br />
`git config --global user.email <your-email>`<br />
To check the configuration, type `git config --list`.
![Git config](/blog_src/assets/img/A-Dive-into-Git_Directory/git_config.png)

Here, we used `--global` flag, so this configuration will be reflected to all the Git repositories on your machine. This configuration is stored in your home directory. Type `cat ~/.gitconfig` to check.
If you use `--local` flag instead, this configuration will be limited to your current repo. This is stored in .git directory. Type `cat .git/config` in git_test folder.

Now, we create a file say `file1` and "Hello World!" to it.
Type the following commands and observe:

`git status`<br />
`git add file1`<br />
`git status`
![Git add](/blog_src/assets/img/A-Dive-into-Git_Directory/tracking_changes.png)

When we created file1 and made changes to it, these changes were present only in the Working Tree i.e. they are not staged/tracked.<br />
`git add` command staged these changes i.e.added them to the Staging Area for committing them further.<br />
Now, we commit these changes.<br />
`git commit -m "First line added to file1"`<br />
`-m` option helps us to add a small message along with the comment. This message should be clear enough so that we can refer to this commit in future if required.<br />
Now, type `git status` again and observe.
![Git commit](/blog_src/assets/img/A-Dive-into-Git_Directory/git_commit.png)

We can see a seven digit hexadecimal number above (c934395). Whenever we commit our changes, Git hashes these changes to a 40 digit hexadecimal number. The figure above is the first seven digits of 40 digits.

Now, see the following operations:
![Git diff](/blog_src/assets/img/A-Dive-into-Git_Directory/git_diff.png)

Note the output of first `git status` above and compare with the previous outputs we got.<br />
`git diff` helps us to check the differences between working tree and the corresponding staged file. Note that file2 is not staged at this point, so `git diff` won't give any output for it.<br />
If we use `git diff --staged`, we can get the changes between the staged files and most recent commit files (Try it before using `git commit`).This will also show the newly staged files not committed before.<br />
In `git add .`, `.` refers to all the new and modified files within the directory.

To check your commits till now, type <br />
`git log`<br />
Same can be checked in `.git/log/HEAD` file.
![Git log](/blog_src/assets/img/A-Dive-into-Git_Directory/git_log.png)

Here `HEAD` nothing but a pointer pointing to the default `master` branch.<br />
If we use `git log -p`, we can see all the changes in each commit compared to its previous commit.

To give a picture of what happened till now, refer below
![Git Current](/blog_src/assets/img/A-Dive-into-Git_Directory/Current_areas.png)

Now, say you want to remove a file2 from Git. So how would you do it?<br />
Approach 1: <br />
`rm file2`<br />
`git add .`<br />
Approach 2: `git rm file2`<br />
This will not only remove file2 from Working Directory, but also from Staging Area. Type `git status` and observe output.
![Git rm](/blog_src/assets/img/A-Dive-into-Git_Directory/git_rm.png)

Commit these changes. Moving on...

Say you have made some changes to a file in the working tree and you want to recover the earlier file version, so what is the way out?<br />
Let's say a line added to file1. Now this change is untracked in the Staging Area. But we have the previously staged file1 in Staging Area.
So we recover this file1 to our file system using 

`git checkout -- file1`

![Undo Working Tree](/blog_src/assets/img/A-Dive-into-Git_Directory/Undo_Working_tree.png)

Now, say we added changes to the Working Tree (in file1) and Staged these changes. We want to recover previously staged file1 (which was committed).
How will we achieve it?
![Undo Staging Area](/blog_src/assets/img/A-Dive-into-Git_Directory/Undo_staging_area.png)

>Tip: Try to think in terms of the logical areas of Git and understand the flow of the commands in the above picture.

How to restore changes from a previous commit?

In the context of our example, we will try to recover the file2. Type<br />
`git log -- file2`<br />
This shows a list of commit that affect file2.
![Recovering from commit](/blog_src/assets/img/A-Dive-into-Git_Directory/Recovering_from_commit.png)

`git checkout <first_five_hash_num> -- file2` can be used to restore changes of file2 from that commit (In this case, restoring the file itself).<br />
`git status` indicates that it changes the Working Tree as well Staging Area. Later we just commit these changes.

Sometimes we don't want Git to pay attention to a few files or folders. It means we don't want to check the changes made to these files. 
For achieving this, Git has `.gitignore` file as a way out.
We create some files with .ab extension, say file1.ab, file2.ab and file3.ab. Also, we create a folder say `trash` which includes some expired or not required stuff.
We don't want to track either of them. So we implement the following <br/>
`vi .gitignore`<br />
In the vi editor, append these lines<br />
```*.ab```<br/>
`trash/`
>Try running `git status` before and after adding the above lines in `.gitignore` and observe the output.

><b>Task:</b> We know that `.git` directory is the main directory recording all Git related information. Now make a new directory and copy your `.git` directory from `git_test` to this new folder and try to retrieve that data in this directory.

Git Branching and Merging:
------------

<a name="branching"></a>

Branching in Git enables developers to work on multiple versions of their work and merge the stable version with the master branch.<br />
Master branch is the the default branch created by Git. 

A branch is nothing but a pointer to a commit. Using different pointers (i.e. branches) leads to different commits. We will take an example and try to visualize it.

To visualise your Commit History graphically, we'll use <br />
`git log --graph --online --all`
>Check the flags used above, using `git log --help`.<br/>
>Also, if possible create an alias of this command. [Here](https://ieee.nitk.ac.in/blog//getting-to-love-the-terminal/) is a reference for it. I will create `graph` as my alias.

We create a new directory name `git_test` and initialise it as Git Repo. Further we create two files file1, and file2 and edit them.<br />
Look at the below picture and observe.
![Git branching example](/blog_src/assets/img/A-Dive-into-Git_Directory/branching_intro.png)

Once the files are staged before, later staging their changes and committing can be performed in a single line using<br/>
`git commit -a -m <message>`<br/>
After the second commit on `master` branch, we can see that `master` is pointing to the commit 981b7c7. It points to the latest commit till now.<br/>
`git checkout -b branch1` creates a branch with name as `branch1`, and the current branch is switched to `branch1` and we can see that it points to the same commit.

Also, we see that `HEAD` is pointing to `branch1`. `HEAD` indicates the current branch on which we are working.

`git checkout <branch_name>` helps to switch to that branch.
>Try to understand the flow of commands and relate it with it's `graph` in the above picture.

We can also create a branch using `git branch <branch_name>`, but it won't automatically switch it to that branch. You will have to do `git checkout <branch_name>`

If you type `git branch`, you can see all the branches and the branch where `HEAD` is pointing.
![Git branch](/blog_src/assets/img/A-Dive-into-Git_Directory/git_branch.png)

><b>Task:</b> Switch to different branches and edit diferent files. You will see that changes in one branch do not affect the changes in other. Think how it may be useful?

<a name="stash"></a>

What happens when we try to switch to another branch without committing to its changes in the current branch?<br/>
Look at the picture below
![Git stash application](/blog_src/assets/img/A-Dive-into-Git_Directory/git_stash1.png)

Git suggests you a way out. It tells you either commit your changes or `Stash` them. The latter one is used when you don't want commit your changes but quickly change to a different branch temporarily.

![Git stash application](/blog_src/assets/img/A-Dive-into-Git_Directory/git_stash2.png)

`git stash` can be used to stash our changes.<br />
`git stash save <message>` can be used to save stash with a message.<br/>
`git stash list` shows a list of stashes. `-p` option helps to check the changes.<br/>
`git stash apply` applies the recent stash.<br/>
`git stash apply stash@{2}` helps us to apply any particular stash (In this case stash@{2}).<br/>
`git stash pop` pops the recent stash and also applies it.

><b>Task:</b>
>> 1. Try to search where are the stashes stored in `.git` folder.
>> 2. Try to search where are the details regarding branch commits and head pointer stored.

<a name="merging"></a>

Moving on to <b>`Merging branches...`<b/>

Now, say you have created a branch, made changes to it, and finally you want to add all these changes to your `master` branch copy.
Here it is required to merge two or more branches.

There are two types of merging techniques:
1. `Fast-Forward`
2. `3-Way`

We continue with our above situation. Look at the picture given below:
![Git merge1](/blog_src/assets/img/A-Dive-into-Git_Directory/git_merge1.png)

We created a new `file3` in `branch2` and committed the changes.<br/>
From the final graph, we observe that there is a direct path between `master` and `branch2`. But there is no direct path between `master` and `branch1` (We will have to pass through their first common ancestor i.e.981b7c7 to create a path between them).

Say we want to merge `branch2` and `master`. Since there is a direct path, we perform the <b>`Fast-Forward Merge`</b>.
Merging `master` with `branch2` is equivalent to moving `master` branch to `branch2`. Check the diagram below.
![Fast-Forward Merge](/blog_src/assets/img/A-Dive-into-Git_Directory/fast_forward_merge.png)

First the checkout `master` branch anad later perform<br/>
`git merge branch2`<br/>
This updated `master` branch to `branch2` changes.<br/>
<b>Note:</b> The direct path can be however long as possible. Fast-Forward Merge will take place as long as there is a direct path.

Now we can delete the `branch2` branch as it is no longer required.
![Branch Deletion](/blog_src/assets/img/A-Dive-into-Git_Directory/branch_deletion.png)

`git branch --merged` can be used to check branches merged with the current branch.<br/>
`git branch -d branch2` can be used delete the <b>merged<b/> branches.

When we try to delete a non-merged branch `-d` gives an error and blocks it. But if you use `-D` instead, any non-merged branch can be deleted.

Now, we have the following configuration and we want to merge `master` and `branch1`. How will we do it?
![Current Config](/blog_src/assets/img/A-Dive-into-Git_Directory/git_merge_current.png)

Fast-Forward merge cannot be performed as there is no <b>direct path</b>.<br/>
Here we have to perform the <b>`3-Way Merge`</b>. Look at the picture below to understand it.
![3-Way Merge](/blog_src/assets/img/A-Dive-into-Git_Directory/three_way.png)

This technique checks the changes in the commits pointed by `master` and `branch1` with their LCA and reflect the changes in the newly merged commit (pointed by both the branches).
![3-Way Merge Performed](/blog_src/assets/img/A-Dive-into-Git_Directory/three_way_performed.png)

`git merge branch1` will open the dafault editor in your system for editing the message. Edit the message or keep it as it is and exit.<br/>
The `master` branch will point to this new commit.<br/>

<a name="mergeconflicts"></a>

Till now, whatever merges we performed, we didn't encounter any <b>`Merge Conflicts`</b>.

<b>Merge Conflicts</b> occur when we try to merge two branches that have changed the same lines in the same file with respect to the LCA.
![Merge Conflict](/blog_src/assets/img/A-Dive-into-Git_Directory/merge_conflict.png)

Initially, there is no fourth line or empty fourth line (in LCA). Later both `master` and `branch` have different fourth lines. This puts Git into a conflict which line to choose.<br/>
If one of branch's line had matched the line of LCA, the merged commit would have had the branch's line (Changed line has higher priority).

See the file1 contents.
![file1 contents](/blog_src/assets/img/A-Dive-into-Git_Directory/file1_content.png)

`=======` indicates that both changed lines have same priority.<br/>
Also `HEAD` and `branch` show the lines in their respective branches (HEAD points master).

Observe the below picture
![Resolve Merge Conflict](/blog_src/assets/img/A-Dive-into-Git_Directory/resolve_conflict.png)

`git status` gives us that merging process has not stopped yet and the conflict exists.<br/>
There are two methods to resolve it:
1. Either abort the merging process by<br/>
`git merge --abort`
2. Or open the file and manually select the lines you want finally in file1. Later stage and commit your changes.<br/>
Later we remove `branch`.

<a name="detachedhead"></a>

Finally, we move on to our last topic under the heading i.e. <b>`DETACHED HEAD`<b/>.

Normally, `HEAD` points to a branch which in turn points to a commit. If we use `git checkout` with a commit, the `HEAD` goes into <b>detached state<b>.
![Detached head state](/blog_src/assets/img/A-Dive-into-Git_Directory/detached_head.png)

There are two ways to get out of it:
1. Checkout a branch in your Git repo.
2. Create a new branch. It will automatically point to this commit(Detached Head Commit). Now checkout this branch.

<a name="gitremotes"></a>

Git Remotes:
------------

Remote in Git is nothing but a repository in another location w.r.t your current location. This another location can be GitHub repo, fork of GitHub repo, a repo on your machine itself or a repo on any other Git Server.

<a name="github"></a>

GitHub is like a cloud where projects can be hosted. Different people can collaborate on a single project hosted on GitHub. It equipped with Git utilities.

<b>Note: </b>GitHub is a Git Server. Similarly, there are many such servers available to share your code. In fact, you can also establish your own local Git Server. [Here](https://www.linux.com/tutorials/how-run-your-own-git-server/) is a link for it.
<br/>This blog won't be covering usage of GitHub. So use this [link](https://help.github.com/en) for GitHub reference.

<a name="remote"></a>

Now, make a repository on your GitHub account (say `git_test`). If you initialize this repo with `README.md`, GitHub will automatically create a first commit which includes this file. Now we want to work on this file on our local system. So how do we make a copy of it on our machine?

We use `git clone` command followed by the `ssh` or `https` link provided by GitHub. For using `ssh` protocol, use will have to set the public key in GitHub. Use the above GitHub reference for it. This blog will be using `https` protocol.
![Git clone](/blog_src/assets/img/A-Dive-into-Git_Directory/git_clone.png)

If your Git configuration is not set globally, set your configuration (either locally or globally as you wish).

Check the following picture:
![Git remote](/blog_src/assets/img/A-Dive-into-Git_Directory/git_remote.png)

<b>Note:</b> `graph` is an alias of `git log --graph --oneline --all`.

`git remote` shows that one remote named `origin` is set up. It is the default name created by Git.<br/>
`git remote -v` shows that `push` and `fetch` links for `origin`. We will understand these in a while.<br/>
Git graph shows the local `master` branch. `HEAD` pointing it indicates that `master` branch is checked out. Here, we see two new branches `origin/master` and `origin/HEAD`.<br/>
`origin/master` branch shows where the remote `origin`'s `master` branch is currently. 
Similar is `origin/HEAD` by the above analogy.<br/>
When we try to check out these branches, we end up in `Detached HEAD` state. Here `HEAD` is on the same commit as `origin/master` (w.r.t above picture). Here we can check the `master` branch of `origin`.

How to update your local repo with the changes done on the remote repo?<br/>
To do this, open the `git_test` repo on GitHub and add a line to README.md and commit your changes.
Now come back to your terminal.
![Git pull](/blog_src/assets/img/A-Dive-into-Git_Directory/git_fetch.png)

We see that `origin/master` is still on the same commit on our local system and not in sync with the remote repo. To update it as remote repo, we use<br/>
`git fetch`
Now, we can see `origin/master` updated. 
`git merge origin/master` helps us to merge our locally checked out `master` with the master of `origin`.

These two functions of updating `origin/master` and merging can be performed by following single command<br>
`git pull`

Now, we'll see how to reflect the local changes in the remote repo?
To show this, we create `file1`, edit it and commit it finally. See the picture below
![Git push](/blog_src/assets/img/A-Dive-into-Git_Directory/git_push.png)

`graph` and `git status` both show that `master` is ahead of `origin/master` by 1 commit.<br/>
`git push` will push the local changes to the remote repo. Here, you will see that user authentication is required. This checks whether the person is authorised to make changes to the remote repo.<br/>
Go to your GitHub account and check that the implemented changes.

<b>Note:</b> These `fetch` and `push` commands use the links we saw in `git remote -v`.

<b>Note:</b> Here we have only one remote set in our local repo, i.e. `origin`. Thus, we didn't mention the remote and the branch explicitly. Generally, we run the following type of commands<br/>
`git fetch <remote> <branch>` <br/>
(E.g., `git fetch origin master` in our case)<br/>
`git pull <remote> <branch>`<br>
`git push <remote> <branch>`<br/>

<a name="tworemotes"></a>

Now, let's move on to setting more remotes.<br/>
Why would it be required to set more than one remotes?<br/>
Say you want to contribute to a project or maybe provide come changes for a project hosted on GitHub and you don't have the edit access. How would you do it?<br/>

Generally, for such kind of activity, we copy this file to our GitHub account. This process is called making a `fork`. Later, we clone this forked repo in our local system.
So, now we have one original repo, a forked repo on our GitHub account and a cloned repo of our fork.
By default, `origin` will be created for this forked repo in our local repo. But if we want to check the changes implemented at the original repo (from which we forked), we add this as our another remote (generally named as `upstream`).
For contributing to the project, we create another branch on our local repo, implement the changes and push them to our forked version. Later we create a `Pull Request` on GitHub.
A <b>Pull Request</b> sends the owner of the file a request of verifying the changes and merging them with their master branch.

Later, if that owner merges our branch with the master, we delete the branch we created on our local system and pull the changes from `upstream/master` and continue our work.

See below picture for adding `upstream`.
![Git upstream](/blog_src/assets/img/A-Dive-into-Git_Directory/git_upstream.png)

I have created a dummy account named `dummydemo` and created a repo called `RemoteRepo`. We will this repo as original repo and fork it to our account and later clone it to our pc.
We see `origin` as our own account fork. We add `upstream` to check the changes at `dummydemo/RemoteRepo` using<br/>
`git remote add <remote-name> <remote-link>`<br/>
Git graph shows that still, it's branches are not updated. So we use<br/>
`git fetch upstream`<br/>
and merge it with our local `master`.

To remove a remote, we can use<br/>
`git remote remove <remote-name>`

><b>Task:</b> Create a new branch on our local `RemoteRepo`, make some changes and push this branch to `origin` (pushing to `upstream` might not be possible as we might not have the edit access). Now, make a `Pull Request` to 
`dummydemo/RemoteRepo` on GitHub. `dummydemo` can verify your changes and merge these to the `master` branch.
