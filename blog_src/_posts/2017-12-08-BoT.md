## Botnet of things

The Internet of Things aka IoT is one of the hot trending topics in the
tech world right now. The IoT is basically a network of devices
connected to the internet, each having a unique IP address. Today, the
Internet of Things plays with the idea of connecting nearly every
manufactured object to the Internet. It is being incorporated into smart
homes, watches, cars, fitness trackers, power grids, thermostats,
contact lenses, pacemakers and what not.

While the Internet of Things brings a new horizon of opportunities,
there are several barriers in respect to making IoT implementations
successful. These include grave security and privacy concerns. Recent
distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks are forcing a shift in how
we think about the Internet of Things (IoT). The debate on the security
risks posed by widespread use of IoT devices has intensified after the
cyber-attack on DNS provider Dyn in October 2016, which affected many
high-profile online service providers like Twitter, Netflix, GitHub and
Quora. This was carried out using a malware named ‘Mirai’, which used a
“botnet of things”.

## What is a botnet? 

A botnet is a collection of internet-connected devices, which may
include PCs, servers, mobile devices and internet of things devices that
are infected and controlled by a common type of malware. The hacker
instructs these botnets to certain things like overloading a website
with a huge number of requests to effectively shut it down, to send
spam, to make money out of clickbaits, and to further spread the malware
itself. These botnets are pretty hard to track and bring down.

## Botnet of things

Until fairly recently, devices used as components of botnets were
usually Windows PCs. The problem, for hackers, with PCs is that their
defence is being strengthened every day. Antimalware tools are pretty
good at detecting problems and evicting botnets. Hence, in recent times,
“Thingbots”, i.e. compromising IoT devices for this purpose is a growing
trend. IoT devices currently are not really sophisticated in terms of
security. The meteoric rise of the IoT industry has forced manufacturers
to prioritise impressive features and cot efficiency, leaving security
as an afterthought. Most of the cheaper IoT devices on the market are
not designed with security in mind, and their hardware isn’t capable of
supporting advanced encryption techniques. One of the biggest
contributors to the risk of future attack is the fact that many IoT
devices have long-standing, widely known software vulnerabilities that
make them vulnerable to exploit and control by remote attackers. Many of
these devices still have their default passwords. These are very easy
targets for hackers, and are being used in botnets. The device will
still work normally, with a lesser bandwidth and might be a bit
sluggish.

Although the Dyn incident caused large-scale disruption, it is
noteworthy that the attack involved only a few hundred thousand
endpoints and a traffic rate of about 1.2 terabits per second. IT firm
Gartner has predicted that there will be more than 20 billion devices
connected to IoT by 2020. If the IoT remains vulnerable to attacks of
this nature, the risk of similar attacks, on a much larger scale is
imminent.  
Some experts are not alarmed by this, as the Dyn attack required 100,000
infected devices and taking control of so many devices on a regular
basis is borderline impossible. However, devices that have been part of
the Mirai botnet will always be infected. If another attack was to take
place, these devices could be called upon as part of the botnet army.
Once a device has been infected, it is very difficult to get rid of the
virus, making discarding the device the only viable solution. 

## How to mitigate this problem?  
IoT botnets will continue to rise. Right now they are an easy resource
to harvest. IoT device manufacturers must act now to build in better
security capabilities and controls. Security standards must be set by
the government for all IoT devices. Until manufacturers step up their
game and create better security practices, it's up to cyber security
firms and the public to be more informed in their daily interactions
with smart objects. Default passwords should be changed and the devices
should be secured. As IoT botnets becoming a clear-and-present danger,
it is only the combined efforts of everyone involved — including
consumers, manufacturers and IT pros — that can stop the threat.
