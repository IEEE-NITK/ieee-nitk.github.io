<p><strong><em>Introduction</em></strong></p>

<p>How many times have you felt guilty about excessive usage of electricity
when you see your monthly bill? Imagine managing the electricity
delivered to your house like you manage activities like personal banking
from a computer!</p>

<p>You will no longer have to wait till the end of the month to know how
many units you have consumed- you have “Smart meters,” and other
mechanisms, will allow you to see how much electricity you use, when you
use it, and its cost. It also comes with real-time pricing, which will
allow you to save money by using less power when electricity is most
expensive.</p>

<p><strong><em>What is a smart grid?</em></strong></p>

<p>The grid, is an electric grid which is a network of transmission lines,
stations, transformers and more that deliver electricity from the power
plant to your houses or establishments. When you connect any device to
the switch, you are actually logging onto this grid. This grid is made
‘smart’ by establishing a two way communication between the customers
and the supply, digitally. Technologies will work with the electrical
grid to respond digitally to our quickly changing electric demand, at
the consumer end.

<p><em>**How does it work? **</em></p>

<p>1.<em>Visualisation technology</em> - It will be able to explore the state of
the grid at the national level and switch within seconds to explore
specific details at the street level. It will provide rapid information
about blackouts and power quality as well as insights into system
operation for utilities. With a platform built on Google Earth, it can
also take advantage of content generated by Google Earth’s user
community.</p>

<p>2.<em>Advanced metering infrastructure</em>-It is based on consumer friendly
efficiency concepts like ‘Prices to devices’-Assuming that energy is
priced on what it costs in near real-time ,price signals are relayed to
“smart” home controllers or end-consumer devices .The devices, in turn,
process the information based on consumers’ wishes and power
accordingly. So, the house or office responds to the occupants, rather
than vice-versa. Unlike the traditional way, where technicians are sent
to each consumer site monthly to record the data manually for the
billing purpose, the smart meters in AMI provide real-time monitoring
capability of electric loads remotely. The information on power usage
can be collected periodically (e.g., every 15 minutes)</p>

  <li><em>Phasor measurement units(PMU</em>) samples voltage and current many
times at a second at a given location to give instantaneous visibility
into the power system.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong><em>How is it better than the existing grid?</em></strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>It can complement the current electric grid system by including
renewable energy resources, such as wind, solar, and biomass, which
is environmentally cleaner as compared to the fossil fuels used in
many bulk electric power generation facilities.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lesser transmission loss due to decreased distance between the
consumer and supply.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Amount of electricity consumed is intimated to the consumer
periodically and hence he/she can decide to modify it and in the
process save it too. The main challenge in implementing this on a
larger scale ,would be the cost of rebuilding the entire electric
grid, to make it smart and in the process, to handle the security
issues that arise because of the networking ability of a smart grid.</p>
