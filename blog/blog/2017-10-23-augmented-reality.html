<p>Whether you have played “Pokémon Go” or not, you’ve probably at least heard of the game. A special app on your smartphone or tablet makes it look like Pokémon is right there in front of you  while you search for and “capture” the different characters.  This game aquainted the world with this fast growing technology Augmented Reality. This new technology, blurs the line between what’s real and what’s computer-generated by enhancing what we see, hear, feel and smell.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-augmented-reality-work">How does Augmented Reality work?</h2>

<p>In most augmented reality applications, a user will see both synthetic and natural light. This is done by overlaying projected images on top of a pair of see-through goggles or glasses, which allow the images and <strong>interactive virtual objects</strong> to layer on top of the user’s view of the real world.
For augmented reality to work you need camera,accelerometer,rotation sensor and some math skills and GPS. Idea behind all of this is to use data from real word, data gathered by the sensors, and process it in the way computer can use.</p>
