<p>What would you preferably use to store your precious data - a hard disk, a pen-drive, a DVD; or perhaps WATER!</p>

<p>Scientists from Germany now believe that water has a memory, meaning that what once was seen as a simple commodity has been closely examined to reveal a scientific revelation, uncovering a mind-blowing truth.</p>

<h2 id="theory">Theory</h2>

<p>Individual drops of water from the same sample were examined at incredibly high magnification, probably the first experiment of this kind and surprisingly scientists were able to physically see that each droplet of water has its own <em>individual microscopic pattern,</em> distinguishable from the next and uniquely beautiful.</p>

<p><em>Different droplets possess varying</em></p>

<p><em>physical structure under high resolution</em></p>

<h2 id="experiments">Experiments</h2>

<p>In a scientific experiment, a group of students were made to obtain one drop of water from the same body, all at the same time. On examination, each of them produced different images.</p>

<p>In the second experiment, a real flower was placed into a body of water, and after a while droplet from the same were sampled and examined. The result produced a mesmerising pattern when hugely magnified, but all of the droplets of this water looked very similar. When the same experiment was one with a different species of flower, the magnified droplet looked completely different, thereby determining that a <em>particular flower is evident in each droplet of water.</em></p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Through this discovery which shows that water has a memory, according to scientists, a new perception of water can be formed. The German scientists believe that as water travels it picks up and stores information from all of the places that it has travelled through, which can thereby connect people to a lot of different places and sources of information depending on the journey that it has been on.</p>

<p>This has even been compared to the human body, of which each is incredibly unique and has an individual DNA unlike any other. Whilst the human body is made up of 70% water, conclusions could be drawn from these new discoveries that human tears <em>can hold a unique memory of an individual being</em>, through the body's store of water hosting a complete store of information that is linked to individual experience suggesting that everyone is globally connected by the water in the human body which travels through ongoing journeys, whereby information along the way is always stored.</p>
