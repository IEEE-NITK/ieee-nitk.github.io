        <title>What is machine learning?</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-is-machine-learning&quot;&gt;What is Machine Learning?&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Machine learning is a school of computer science that focuses on programming machines to improve their performance through data and iteration. The machine can learn without being explicitly programmed. Yes, you read it right. This is called Artificial intelligence, where we feed in data into the machine, and it learns the data and predicts the output for any other input given. Machine learning is broadly classified into&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Supervised Learning In supervised learning, we have an idea of the relationship between the inputs and the outputs from the dataset given. It is further classified into...</description>

        <title>An Overview of Tarjan's Algorithm</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Strong components in directed graphs are components in which all vertices are strongly connected to each other. 2 vertices A and B are strongly connected if there is a directed path from A-&amp;gt;B and B-&amp;gt;A.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Need for Computing Strongly Connected Components&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Computing strong components for graphs has been a need in computation since many years now. Biologists use the strong components to find out sub-ecosystems in a food chain. During the early advent of the internet, this became an absolute necessity as dependency graphs of various software modules needed to be processed and their strong components extracted,...</description>

        <title>SLAM Coverage Algorithms</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SLAM Coverage Algorithms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With the increased use of robots in industries, the need for robots to be more efficient is incredibly high. One of the key concerns is the way in which they commute. Gone are the days when robots were restricted to moving in a pre-defined path, and one of the most fundamental technologies for locomotion of mobile robots are coverage algorithms. Coverage algorithms require that they allow the bot to cover the maximum area possible without any human intervention. In previously used algorithms, the coverage was achieved with robots crossing the entire length possible in a straight line...</description>

Its inhabitants are called &lt;em&gt;“capitolates”&lt;/em&gt;. Every capitolate in Capital city wants to live a happy and peaceful life. Now Capital city has three divisions - Residential town, Fun town and &lt;strong&gt;market city&lt;/strong&gt;. Residential town is where capitolates live. Fun town is where they meet friends and make merry. Market city is where they work to make a living. But every passing year, capitolates are becoming more and more frustrated and unhappy. The reason is that people from neighbouring lands want...</description>

        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;web-vulnerabilities&quot;&gt;Web Vulnerabilities&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;A vulnerability is a hole or a weakness in the application, which can be a design flaw or an implementation bug, that allows an attacker to cause harm to the stakeholders of an application. Websites across the world are programmed with different programming languages. Although each specific language have specific vulnerabilities ,issues exist fundamental to the internet that can show up disregarding the choosen language or framework used.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some Web Vulnerabilities&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;SQL Injection&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cross Site Request Forgery&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cross Site Scripting&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Server Side Request Forgery&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;sql-injection&quot;&gt;SQL INJECTION&lt;/h2&gt;...</description>

Quartz, Berlinite (AlPO4), Sucrose (table sugar), Topaz, Tourmaline-group minerals, Lead titanate, etc. are some examples of naturally occurring piezoelectric materials. Some of the biological materials exhibiting piezoelectricity include silk, wood, enamel, tendon, etc. Barium titanate, Lead zirconate titanate, Potassium niobate, Sodium tungstate, Zinc oxide, etc., fall under the category of Synthetic ceramics that exhibit the piezoelectric effect. Piezoelectric effect is also exhibited...</description>

Li-Fi is a technology that does exactly that. Li-Fi was unveiled by &lt;em&gt;Dr. Harald Haas&lt;/em&gt; in his iconic 2011 TED Talk entitled &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaoSp4NpkGg&quot;&gt;Wireless data from every light bulb&lt;/a&gt;, where he demonstrated Li-Fi in public for the first time. Li-Fi (which is an acronym for &lt;strong&gt;Light Fidelity&lt;/strong&gt;), is a light-based communication system that is capable of transmitting data at high speeds over the visible,...</description>

It was launched to test various upcoming technologies in space, its conditions, outcomes, threats or limitations of the proposed technology etc. in real time in space rather than earthly simulations. We are interested to learn how DS1 or any satellite in outer space carry out efficient communications to Space stations in Earth. For this, we must first be aware of Deep...</description>

        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;autopilots&quot;&gt;AUTOPILOTS&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;An autopilot is a flight control system that allows a pilot to fly an airplane without continuous hands-on control of the airplane. It allows the pilot to focus on higher-order tasks such as navigating, communicating with air traffic control, planning for weather contingencies and rerouting associated with any kind of emergency circumstance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/img/autopilot/Figure_1.png&quot; alt=&quot;A simple autopilot combined with conventional navigation instruments.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;first-autopilots&quot;&gt;FIRST AUTOPILOTS&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the early days of aviation, pilots had to control the aircraft all the time to fly safely. As aircraft range increased and the flight durations increased, it became a serious problem...</description>
