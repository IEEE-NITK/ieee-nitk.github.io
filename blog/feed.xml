        <title>Social Engineering</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;social-engineering&quot;&gt;Social Engineering&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Have you ever stared into the keyboard while your friend is typing a password? Or have you ever made up stories to play a prank on your friend? If the answer to any of the above questions is yes then you are a &lt;strong&gt;social engineer!&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/img/social-engineering/0.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt; Well now that I have said that you are a social engineer let’s see what that really means. It refers to psychological manipulation of people into performing actions or giving away confidential information. A type of confidence trick for the purpose of information gathering, fraud, or system access....</description>

        <title>The Missing Circuit Element</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-missing-circuit-element&quot;&gt;The Missing Circuit element&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Leon Chau, an American circuit theorist at the University of California, predicted the existence of the fourth fundamental circuit passive element. The first three passive circuit elements are the resistor, capacitor, and inductor. We already have relationships among voltage, current, charge, and flux. The only relationship missing is that between flux and charge(q).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/img/the-missing-circuit-element/1.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Image 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Memristor is the component that connects the dots. The diagram shows how memristor serves as a missing link and completes the symmetry of the diagram due to which it is famously known as &lt;strong&gt;“The Missing Circuit element”&lt;/strong&gt;....</description>

        <title>Self Healing Materials</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A breakthrough for bio-inspired technology.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many natural organisms have the ability to repair themselves. Now, manufactured machines will be able to mimic this property. Researchers have created a self-healing material that spontaneously repairs itself under extreme mechanical damage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-biomimicry-&quot;&gt;What is biomimicry ?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Game-changing ideas begin by seeing the possibility for sustainable life reflected in the living system around us. Biomimicry is an approach to innovation that seeks sustainable solutions to human challenges by emulating nature’s time-tested patterns and strategies. The goal is to create products, processes, and policies which guide us to a new lifestyle that is sustainable and...</description>

        <title>Heard of Smart Contracts yet?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Smart contract, also known as a cryptocontract , is a computer program that directly controls the transfer of digital currencies or assets between parties under certain conditions.It not only defines the rules and penalties related to an agreement in the same way that a traditional contract does, but it also automatically enforces those obligations. Smart contract are similar to a contract in the physical world, but it’s digital and is represented by a tiny computer program stored inside a blockchain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the main idea behind a Smart Contract?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Since a smart contract removes reliance on a third party...</description>

        <title>Photocatalytic Detoxification</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;photocatalytic-detoxification&quot;&gt;Photocatalytic Detoxification&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;The water bodies around the world are regularly dumped with waste water effluents. These contain various organic and inorganic molecules that affect the aquatic life and overall water quality, which is called water pollution. The surprising fact is that quite a lot of purification is caused naturally by the breakdown of these molecules by sunlight. This process can be assisted with colloidal semiconductors to speed up the reaction process and increase the efficiency. The photocatalytic detoxification of wastewater is a process that combines heterogeneous catalysis with solar technologies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Organic compounds such as alcohols,carboxylic acids,amines, herbicides and aldehydes,...</description>

        <title>How Computers learn to play games!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wondered how computers learn to play games like Chess or Go? Or how do they replace human players in Ludo or Card games? How Google’s Alpha-Go defeated the &lt;strong&gt;World Champion&lt;/strong&gt; of Go? Let us dive in the field of Computer Games and find out how Computers learn to play Games!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/img/How Computers LearnToPlayGames/chess.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Chess&quot; title=&quot;Chess&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are various algorithms that are used to make a computer learn to play games. I will be discussing some of them to give you some intuition on how these algorithms work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;naive-tree-search&quot;&gt;Naive Tree Search&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let’s start with a...</description>
