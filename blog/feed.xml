        <title>When strokes are six</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Man and his car - The stories are different, yet the same . From the spark that taught him about fire and the wheels that took him to places, to the roads that he hit everyday, he has come a long way. The love and passion to be in one, to feel its heartbeat and power, to drive and tame them, he has always loved them. But rare are those who are interested in the technology that drives their beasts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is said that technology advances in rapid pace. Though it is right for a majority of areas, advancements in...</description>

        <title>A QuickStart Guide to Image Processing with OpenCV</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Why learn Image Processing? This is the question I was primarily asked when I first started exploring just exactly what Image Processing can offer. As time passed, I soon found the now seemingly obvious answer. Although the name, Image Processing, itself suggests manipulating an image for either aesthetic pleasure or requirement, Image Processing actually provides a gateway for the next revolution in engineering. As more and more people become accustomed to having human tasks being done by machines, image processing becomes crucial in training and programming these machines to flourish. Image processing not only provides the framework for Computer Vision...</description>

        <title>Is Random really Random?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Random numbers have been used for many thousands of years. Roll a dice. Flip a coin. Pick a card from a deck. Whatever the result may be in these three situations, it’s completely random each time and there’s no way of predicting it by looking at the previous outcomes. In other words, the end result is left to random chance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/img/random-number-generator/dice.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Dice&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Random number generators in a computer are similar: they’re an attempt to achieve an unpredictable, random result. From creating random keys for data encryption to random shuffling cards in a poker website, generation of random numbers...</description>

        <title>Smart Phones and Health issues</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The way smartphones have changed our lives is amazing. Technology has been ever bringing multiple facets of our daily lives within the scope of smartphones, which in turn gets smaller and slimmer. No more does our parents bother us to go and pay telephone or electricity bills (if you were a 90’s kid :P) neither does shopkeepers curse you for not having suitable denominations. It has all come down to few swipes and touches. As new innovations brought the world closer and time shorter, it has not come without any drawbacks, same with the case of smartphones. Again, it’s the...</description>

        <title>Of a tooth and a pie</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;At first, I thought I would write about the wonder creation of yesteryear-Bluetooth. Give you a little insight into how it works, the various layers of Bluetooth, it’s profiles and so on. But I guess Wikipedia would do a much better job at it. So, I decided to share something I learned during my internship- how we can &lt;strong&gt;make use of the inbuilt Bluetooth controller in Raspberry Pi 3 to implement some of the profiles of Bluetooth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;First, you need to know that &lt;strong&gt;Raspberry Pi&lt;/strong&gt; is nothing but a Linux machine and can be governed by some commands that you...</description>

        <title>Ever wondered why exactly are high lift devices needed? Let me tell you...</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;ever-wondered-why-exactly-are-high-lift-devices-needed-let-me-tell-you&quot;&gt;Ever wondered why exactly are high lift devices needed? Let me tell you…&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lift generated by wings of an aircraft is estimated by the following relationship,&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;\begin{equation} L = \frac{1}{2}\rho v^2 A C_L \end{equation}&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Where:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;$L$ = lift force generated&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;$\rho$ = air density&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;$v$ = true air speed&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;$A$ = lifting area of the wing&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;$C_L$ = coefficient of lift&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Clearly, same amount of lift can be generated by various permutations and combinations of $\rho$, $v$, $A$ and $C_L$.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, let us think about situations when $v$ is quite less, take-off or landing for instance, that the lift...</description>

It may seem like a new technology but history points out that it is no recent development.[ In fact, 3D printing has its roots in the 1980s. In 1984, Chuck Hull, invented a process called “stereolithography” which used UV lasers to solidify photopolymer that created 3D parts layer by layer. A technology which initially began with the aim of prototyping has today secured its place in the manufacturing industry. Today its use is far more...</description>

        <title>An Introduction to Reinforcement Learning</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;an-introduction-to-reinforcement-learning&quot;&gt;An Introduction to Reinforcement Learning&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Imagine you are trying to train a dog to do fetch a ball. What you’d normally do is that you would reward it a snack every time it fetched the ball. The dog would then associate the snack with the act of fetching and would do it every time in the hope of a treat. Ladies and gentlemen, this is Reinforcement Learning. Cue the curtains. We’re done here. ;)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;wait-what-you-didnt-tell-me-what-reinforcement-learning-actually-is&quot;&gt;Wait what? You didn’t tell me what Reinforcement Learning actually is.&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;All jokes aside, Reinforcement Learning is the area of machine learning which resembles...</description>

It is just like how chemists study different elements, their reactivity, their compounds, etc, in number theory mathematicians boil numbers, titrate them, react with numbers and form number complexes (complex numbers).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;group&quot;&gt;Group&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;A group is a set of elements $G = {…}$ and an operation $#$.
