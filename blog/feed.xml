        <title>THE NEW BIOMETRIC - BRAINPRINT</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE NEW BIOMETRIC - BRAINPRINT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since the conception of computers, mobile phones, tablets and most&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;importantly, Internet, securing our devices and data has become crucial.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Personal data ranging from shopping wishlists to bank details are either stored&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;in PCs or are available online, all protected by passwords - a rather impotent&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;sentinel, as it turns out. There have been several methods used by computers&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;as well as the different websites to authenticate its user.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first passwords were simple and easily stored since sophisticated&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;hacking networks did not exist yet. One such example is, Cryptographer&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Robert Morris, who created the...</description>

        <title>Quantum Supremacy: Is it hyped?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The term “quantum computer” has been buzzing around in recent years. But what is a quantum computer? Have they been built? How are they different from a classical computer? What kind of problems do they solve? Do I need to be an expert in physics to understand them?(Not really!). These may be some of the questions arising in your mind when you hear someone say “quantum computer”. In this article, I will address these questions by giving a basic understanding of quantum computer and what makes it so special.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;fundamentals&quot;&gt;Fundamentals&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;All the electronic devices that we use in our...</description>

        <title>Evolving Strings with Genetic Algorithms</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;A genetic algorithm is a search heuristic inspired by Darwin’s theory of natural evolution. A genetic algorithm reflects the process of natural selection: the fittest survive and breed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The process of natural selection begins by selecting the fittest individuals from a population. The cross to produce offsprings that have characterestics of both parents. If both parents have good fitness, then their child is also likely to inherit their characterestics and have better fitness.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this introduction, we will be trying to match a string from scratch.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;environment-and-population&quot;&gt;Environment and Population&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;First, we need to define an environment that...</description>

        <title>Nanomotors</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;﻿Nanotechnology was regarded to be the technology of the future. Well, the future has come. Its no more the technology of the future. Scientists and engineers have become increasingly good at designing and engineering materials down at the level of atoms and molecules. Nanotechnology is the manipulation of matter at nanoscale which is about 1-100 nanometres. Its well known that everything in this universe is made out of atoms and it’s the atoms and the arrangement of these atoms that dictate the characteristics. Two wheels and a handle, although are said to make a bicycle, it’s called a bicycle only...</description>

        <title>Earthing Systems</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Many appliances such as an electric heater, a refrigerator, a CPU etc. have metallic body (casing).If with use the insulation of a wire breaks or melts , the live wire may touch the casing. If we happen to touch the casing carrying a current we may receive a severe shock.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/img/earthing-systems/image001.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image001&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To avoid this, metal casing of all electrical appliances are earthed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/img/earthing-systems/image002.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image002&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-an-earthing-system&quot;&gt;What is an earthing system?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The connection between electrical appliances and devices with the earth plate or electrode through a thick wire of low resistance to provide safety is known...</description>

        <title>Chain of Things</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The Internet will disappear. There will be so many IP addresses, so many devices, sensors, things that you are wearing, things that you are interacting with, that you won’t even sense it. It will be part of your presence all the time.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;These words, spoken in the World Economic Forum in 2015 by Google’s then Chairman Eric Schmidt, are quickly proving to be true. From smart homes to smart citites, the &lt;strong&gt;Internet of Things&lt;/strong&gt; is everywhere. The number of connected devices has grown by a whopping 31% over the last year. However, all this data is present on...</description>

        <title>Diving into and Exploiting the Heap</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;At the physical level, computer memory consists of a large number of flip flops. Each flip flop consists of a few transistors, and is capable of storing one bit. Individual flip flops are addressable by a unique identifier, so we can read and overwrite them. Thus, conceptually, we can think of all of our computer’s memory as just one giant array of bits that we can read and write.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since as humans, we are not that good at doing all of our thinking and arithmetic in bits, we group them into larger groups, which together can be used to represent...</description>

        <title>Computational Approaches of Shock Waves</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In this article I would like to discuss the two different CFD approaches while solving for flows involving shock waves.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In flow fields involving shock waves there is a sharp discontinuous change in the flow variables like pressure, density, temperature, etc. across the shock. The first approach is to have the shock wave appear naturally in the computational domain as a direct solution of the governing equations. This is called the &lt;em&gt;shock capturing method.&lt;/em&gt; The second approach is to explicitly introduce the shock wave into the flow and then solve the governing equations for the rest of the domain (between...</description>

        <title>Charge Crowding</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;charge-crowding&quot;&gt;Charge crowding&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;electrostatic-discharge&quot;&gt;Electrostatic Discharge&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Electrostatic Discharge, or ESD, is a single-event, rapid transfer of electrostatic charge between two objects, usually resulting when two objects at different potentials come into direct contact with each other. ESD can also occur when a high electrostatic field develops between two objects in close proximity. ESD is one of the major causes of device failures in the semiconductor industry Electrostatic charge build-up occurs as a result of an imbalance of electrons on the surface of a material. Such a charge build-up develops an electric field that has measurable effects on other objects at...</description>
