        <title>Hyperloop</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;hyperloop&quot;&gt;Hyperloop&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;  &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/img/hyperloop/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the most valued and important entity nowadays is time. To help the people around the world to save their   travelling time, Elon Musk came up with an innovative idea of hyperloop. Hyperloop is a proposed mode of passenger and freight transportation that would propel a pod-like vehicle through a reduced-pressure tube that could potentially exceed airliner speeds. The pods would accelerate to cruising speed gradually using a linear electric motor and glide above their track using passive magnetic levitation or air bearings. The tubes could also go above ground on columns...</description>

        <title>A talk with - Gaurav Hegde</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/img/gaurav_hegde_interview/Gaurav.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Gaurav Hegde&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;back-story&quot;&gt;Back-Story&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hello guys, I am Abijith, third year EEE. I had this opportunity among many opportunities to interview and talk to Gaurav. In my two years of IEEE and NITK life, I have been in touch with him for only one semester, because he took a semester off in his 7th semester. That semester has been the best academic semester for me. The discussions, the treats, the interactions, the projects, the amount of knowledge that this person has! Oh good lord!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anyway, without any further ado, presenting Gaurav. Note: Questions are in &lt;strong&gt;bold&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3...</description>

        <title>Graphene - A Wonder Material</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;graphene--a-wonder-material&quot;&gt;GRAPHENE – A WONDER MATERIAL&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I have never even heard of this term graphene before”, might be your thought process presently. Read further to understand why I call it a wonder material. What’s running in your mind at this point of time due to similarity in what you have studied is Graphite, an allotrope of Carbon which is very commonly found. But, what’s Graphene then? Yes, graphite and graphene are in fact the same except for a few structural differences which brings in unexpected properties. Graphite consists of various layers of Carbon atoms where each layer is arranged in...</description>

        <title>Fluid mechanics in everyday life</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;applying-makeup&quot;&gt;Applying Makeup!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/img/fluid-mech-everyday-life/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Image1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When you put on eye shadow or powder, you are most definitely applying shear and pressure forces. When you put foundation on a sponge and smear it over your face you can feel the shear stress acting on your face. Furthermore, the shear stress increases as the foundation moves from the sponge to your face. This causes no slip at the boundary, which allows the foundation to stick to your face rather than slide off. This is a great example of Couette Flow!!! It is amazing to realize how much fluid mechanics applies...</description>

        <title>The Fourth Industrial Revolution</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Automation, Internet of Things, Genetic engineering, cloud computing, renewable energy, sustainable development. Welcome to the Future. Welcome to the 4th Industrial revolution.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/img/the-fourth-industrial-revolution/pic1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Professor Klaus Schwab, Founder and Executive Chairman of the World Economic Forum published the ‘The Fourth Industrial Revolution’. Through this he explained its impact on economies, countries, politics and even ideologies. The fourth industrial revolution focuses on making our industries more productive with automation cloud computing and IoT, shying away from fossil fuels and making super-soldiers (through genetic engineering!). That last one is questionable though…&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Genetic engineering will help us in not only rectifying...</description>

All of us have at least once thought of owning a robot that could do our assignments, or just do things that we are lazy to do. And then, as you enter your college, you take online courses for learning how to build robots that follow lines, identify colours and do all sorts of things that you think it should...</description>

        <title>Introduction to Reverse Engineering</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I am sure you would have fixed a bug if you have done programming. Going through your code, identifying places where it could have gone wrong, trying out different inputs to make it easier, each one with your own different methods! You also would have learnt to make your debugging process simpler with your experience for sure. Congratulations for your first step towards an important skill required for reverse engineering :)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lets begin with a simple intuitive understanding of reverse engineering. You have a toy gun in which you can load bullets and shoot. One fine day, it stops working!...</description>

        <title>Implementing Google Image Search Style Grid</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;implementing-google-image-search-style-grid&quot;&gt;Implementing Google Image Search Style Grid&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;I love design principles of Google. The way they present things is really awesome. One such presentation is Google Image Search.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/img/google_image_search/google_image_search.png&quot; alt=&quot;Google Image Search&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Look at the way they arrange images. Each row has a fixed width, but their are no columns. The images have arranges themselves, intelligently, just enough to fit the row. I always wondered, what algorithm they must have used to achieve this.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-thought&quot;&gt;What I thought&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;So my search began. Initially I thought they might have used some kind of knapsack algorithm to fit images to...</description>

They could turn out to be expensive depending upon the quality of light you expect. There are RGB strips available too! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;2.&lt;strong&gt;TIP 31 switch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Now this is a power transistor that can withstand large currents that the LED strips demand&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;3.&lt;strong&gt;AUX cable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This is to connect your music player to the device&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;4.&lt;strong&gt;12V battery&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The LED strips demand a lot of current, so get one that supplies enough. There are rechargeable lead acid batteries available. They are cheaper, but bulkier...</description>

        <title>The Class of NP</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Many of us have this notion that NP stands for “Non Polynomial”, the problems which can’t be solved in polynomial time. This is not true. First of all, NP consist of only decision problem (given any problem, the answer should be yes or no) solvable in polynomial time by a theoretical non-deterministic Turing machine. Well, I am not going to cover non-deterministic Turing machine in this blog, so I will give another verifier based definition.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;verifier-based-definition&quot;&gt;Verifier Based Definition:&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Consider a decision problem X. Let I be an instance of X for which the answer is “yes”. Now if we...</description>
