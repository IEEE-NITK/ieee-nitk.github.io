        <title>Peeking into a hacker's mind - an Interview with Kishor Bhat</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/img/kishor-bhat-interview/kishor.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Kishor Bhat&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As our world becomes increasingly networked, protecting these networks is no longer optional. A majority of today’s companies are insufficiently prepared for a cyber attack. Unfortunately, very few in NITK have cyber-security as their interest.I hope this interview with Kishor Bhat ,a cyber-security enthusiast motivates the readers into understanding the importance of cyber security in today’s digital world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;1-how-important-are-ctfs-to-a-security-enthusiast-give-an-account-of-your-experiences-from-playing-ctfs&quot;&gt;1. How important are CTFs to a security enthusiast? Give an account of your experiences from playing CTFs&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;In my opinion, pretty important.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For the uninitiated, CTFs or Capture the Flag contests are security competitions that...</description>

        <title>A talk with - Abin Alex Pothen</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/img/abin-alex-interview/abin.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Abin Alex&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;back-story&quot;&gt;Back-Story&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hello guys, today I had a great opportunity to interview Abin Alex. He has done his BTech in Mechanical from NITK. He was an executive member of IEEE and SIGHT Chair in 2015. He is currently a Research Assistant in IISc and is working on stability of systems. With the amount of experience he possesses and the air of intelligence he creates around the person he is interacting with, it was a great opportunity for me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-one-thing-you-want-mechanical-students-to-remember&quot;&gt;What is one thing you want mechanical students to remember?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;That question can be answered in...</description>

Most engineering problems and their math models are inherently under-constrained. It is not surprising, we have all seen physics problems give under-constrained systems. The best example is in the definition of electric potential. All electric potentials are with reference to potentials at infinity where...</description>

        <title>Hyperloop</title>

To help the people around the world to save their   travelling time, Elon Musk came up with an innovative idea of hyperloop. Hyperloop is a proposed mode of passenger and freight transportation that would propel a pod-like vehicle through a reduced-pressure tube that could potentially exceed airliner speeds. The pods would accelerate to cruising speed gradually using a linear electric motor and glide above their track using passive magnetic levitation or air bearings. The tubes could also go above ground on columns...</description>

        <title>Graphene - A Wonder Material</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;graphene--a-wonder-material&quot;&gt;GRAPHENE – A WONDER MATERIAL&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I have never even heard of this term graphene before”, might be your thought process presently. Read further to understand why I call it a wonder material. What’s running in your mind at this point of time due to similarity in what you have studied is Graphite, an allotrope of Carbon which is very commonly found. But, what’s Graphene then? Yes, graphite and graphene are in fact the same except for a few structural differences which brings in unexpected properties. Graphite consists of various layers of Carbon atoms where each layer is arranged in...</description>

        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;promises-closures-and-potatoes&quot;&gt;Promises, Closures and Potatoes.&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Well this article is mainly about Promises and Closures, two concepts that most of us don’t really care about in the beginning, but in reality, we have been using it a lot. “Promises and Closures” wouldn’t sound cool so I thought of slightly innovative title.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;so-what-are-promises&quot;&gt;So what are promises?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;They are not new, and they are pretty popular for a long time. &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/img/promises-closures-and-potatoes/image1.png&quot; alt=&quot;image1&quot; /&gt; Promises gives you this feature of asynchronous nature in the code. It actually lets a third agent interact with your code: let’s take a small example. Assume that...</description>

I had this opportunity among many opportunities to interview and talk to Gaurav. In my two years of IEEE and NITK life, I have been in touch with him for only one semester, because he took a semester off in his 7th semester. That semester has been the best academic semester for me. The discussions, the treats, the interactions, the projects, the amount of knowledge that this person has! Oh good lord!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anyway, without any further ado, presenting Gaurav. Note: Questions are in &lt;strong&gt;bold&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3...</description>

        <title>Fluid mechanics in everyday life</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;applying-makeup&quot;&gt;Applying Makeup!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/img/fluid-mech-everyday-life/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Image1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When you put on eye shadow or powder, you are most definitely applying shear and pressure forces. When you put foundation on a sponge and smear it over your face you can feel the shear stress acting on your face. Furthermore, the shear stress increases as the foundation moves from the sponge to your face. This causes no slip at the boundary, which allows the foundation to stick to your face rather than slide off. This is a great example of Couette Flow!!! It is amazing to realize how much fluid mechanics applies...</description>

        <title>The Fourth Industrial Revolution</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Automation, Internet of Things, Genetic engineering, cloud computing, renewable energy, sustainable development. Welcome to the Future. Welcome to the 4th Industrial revolution.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/img/the-fourth-industrial-revolution/pic1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Professor Klaus Schwab, Founder and Executive Chairman of the World Economic Forum published the ‘The Fourth Industrial Revolution’. Through this he explained its impact on economies, countries, politics and even ideologies. The fourth industrial revolution focuses on making our industries more productive with automation cloud computing and IoT, shying away from fossil fuels and making super-soldiers (through genetic engineering!). That last one is questionable though…&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Genetic engineering will help us in not only rectifying...</description>

All of us have at least once thought of owning a robot that could do our assignments, or just do things that we are lazy to do. And then, as you enter your college, you take online courses for learning how to build robots that follow lines, identify colours and do all sorts of things that you think it should...</description>
