        <title>A Comprehensive Guide to Li-Fi</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/img/a-comprehensive-guide-to-lifi/1.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Li-Fi Visual&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wouldn’t it be interesting if we could use our everyday LED bulbs as the transmitters of data for wirelessly accessing the internet, instead of Wi-Fi Routers or Cellular Networks? Li-Fi is a technology that does exactly that. Li-Fi was unveiled by &lt;em&gt;Dr. Harald Haas&lt;/em&gt; in his iconic 2011 TED Talk entitled &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaoSp4NpkGg&quot;&gt;Wireless data from every light bulb&lt;/a&gt;, where he demonstrated Li-Fi in public for the first time. Li-Fi (which is an acronym for &lt;strong&gt;Light Fidelity&lt;/strong&gt;), is a light-based communication system that is capable of transmitting data at high speeds over the visible,...</description>

        <title>DS1: A demonstration spacecraft and its communication aspects</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;deep-space-1-how-and-what-does-it-do-on-space&quot;&gt;Deep Space 1: How and what does it do on Space??&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Deep Space 1 or DS1 is a satellite launched by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in 1998 to serve its purpose as a technology demonstration spacecraft. It was launched to test various upcoming technologies in space, its conditions, outcomes, threats or limitations of the proposed technology etc. in real time in space rather than earthly simulations. We are interested to learn how DS1 or any satellite in outer space carry out efficient communications to Space stations in Earth. For this, we must first be aware of Deep...</description>

        <title>Autopilot</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;autopilots&quot;&gt;AUTOPILOTS&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;An autopilot is a flight control system that allows a pilot to fly an airplane without continuous hands-on control of the airplane. It allows the pilot to focus on higher-order tasks such as navigating, communicating with air traffic control, planning for weather contingencies and rerouting associated with any kind of emergency circumstance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/img/autopilot/Figure_1.png&quot; alt=&quot;A simple autopilot combined with conventional navigation instruments.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;first-autopilots&quot;&gt;FIRST AUTOPILOTS&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the early days of aviation, pilots had to control the aircraft all the time to fly safely. As aircraft range increased and the flight durations increased, it became a serious problem...</description>

        <title>Bluetooth Low Energy</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We all know how infuriating it is when our devices drains battery when it uses wireless communication like wifi, bluetooth, infra-red. In every device we use, we are always concerned with the &lt;strong&gt;power consumption&lt;/strong&gt;. A device which consumes less power is always favourable. So in this article, I am going to elucidate an effective solution to the power problem in wireless communication- &lt;strong&gt;Bluetooth Low Energy&lt;/strong&gt; , also known as &lt;strong&gt;BLE&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1 id=&quot;why-ble&quot;&gt;Why BLE?&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Historically, &lt;strong&gt;classic bluetooth&lt;/strong&gt; (the bluetooth we are all aware of) was mainly designed to replace cable and it covers many protocols. And with speeds increasing with new...</description>

        <title>Why do Generative Adversarial Nets matter?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A new class of &lt;strong&gt;Generative Models&lt;/strong&gt; was proposed in 2014 by &lt;strong&gt;Ian Goodfellow&lt;/strong&gt; (a.k.a The GANfather) which brought in a novel method of dealing with issues in ML and AI. The Invention of &lt;strong&gt;Generative Adversarial Networks&lt;/strong&gt; (GANs) can be regarded as one of the path-breaking innovations in making computers do useful stuff. GANs have seen some crazy development from an application perspective and has been one of the hottest topics for research in the past 5 years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;so-what-does-a-generative-model-do&quot;&gt;So what does a Generative Model do?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The main objective of a Generative Model is to create more samples of the &lt;strong&gt;same&lt;/strong&gt;...</description>

        <title>Who doesn't want to live on another planet?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The colonization of Mars has been a popular theme of discussion over the past few decades. Whether it's in the spirit of exploration, expansion of human settlement or mining for additional resources, the idea of inhabiting another planet has allured us.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is also evident in how often the idea of colonizing Mars appears in fiction and pop culture: from &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot; by Ray Bradbury to &quot;The Martian&quot; by Andy Weir, the prospect of humans inhabiting the red planet has been explored from the perspectives of fantasy to science.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Keeping aside the political and ethical challenges that are intrinsic...</description>

        <title>Bionics - The Gap between disability and ability</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.Bionics and its growing relevance&lt;/strong&gt; The rise of bionics has prompted some interesting questions- &lt;strong&gt;Can we trade away our biological body for a repairable one , one that won’t age?&lt;/strong&gt;. Bionics is defined as the science of connecting biological systems to artificial systems to develop machines that can imitate our biology. As bionic systems and transhuman augmentations exceed human capabilities humanity might soon face an interesting dichotomy - &lt;strong&gt;Either remain physically inferior and embody the cherished values of humanism&lt;/strong&gt; as we know them or to become a &lt;strong&gt;superior transhuman with a repairable body that can transcend the decay of aging&lt;/strong&gt;....</description>

        <title>Generate Strange Text with GPT-2</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;GPT-2 refers to a set of &lt;em&gt;Language Models&lt;/em&gt; released recently by OpenAI. My objective is to find weird ways that GPT-2 can fail, and also some smart things it is capable of. I’ll be using &lt;a href=&quot;https://talktotransformer.com/&quot;&gt;talktotransformer&lt;/a&gt; for this task. It’s a convenient tool that asks for a short text prompt, and then generates several lines of text to continue the prompt (no coding required!).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;First, let’s see if you’re paying attention. Check out the following two samples:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Department of applied mechanics and hydraulics of National Institute of Technology - Karnataka (NIT-K), Suratkal will host a 3-day workshop on...</description>
