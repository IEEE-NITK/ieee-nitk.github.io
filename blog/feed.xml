        <title>Log file parsing and formats of report generation</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone, today I will be talking about the core part of my work during my summer internship at Samsung Semiconductor India R&amp;amp;D Center, Bengaluru. Our project team consisted of four members and we were given the task to parse log files generated by a testing framework called as Jenkins (now a very popular tool for continuous integration and deployment of source code) and present the parsed data in a HTML, XLSX and JSON format. We were also required to develop plotting and charting utilities for the parsed data in the Excel files.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;log-file-parsing&quot;&gt;Log file parsing&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Log files are...</description>

        <title>Cuba and Candela - Thin shell structures and their strength through curvature</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Before plunging into understanding the beauty of the thin shell structures or even knowing whatgwho the candela in the title refers to. Let us imagine a scenario where you’re at an eatery. You pick up a slice of pizza, and you’re about to take a bite. But it flops over and sags about your fingers. Maybe you should have gone for fewer toppings? No really. Enough experience with pizzas has taught us that folding the pizza slice into a U-shape keeps the pizza from flopping over .&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/img/cuba-and-candela/image001.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;img1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Behind this simple intuition there lies a powerful mathematical...</description>

Why not core electrical? What fascinated you take up SP?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Honestly, in the beginning of my second year, I just decided to choose a topic and go deep into it so that it will help me fetch an internship easily. Having a few projects related to music processing in mind, I decided to learn more about Signal Processing. With the recent boom in Machine Learning applications in SP, I realized that there were a lot of problem statements which could be taken up even at the B.Tech level. Having developed this interest in SP, I decided to...</description>

        <title>Multitenancy</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-is-multitenancy&quot;&gt;What is Multitenancy?&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to Wikipedia, the term “software multitenancy” refers to a software architecture in which a single instance of software runs on a server and serves multiple tenants. With a multitenant architecture, a software application is designed to provide every tenant a dedicated share of the resources.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/img/multitenancy/difference.png&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot; title=&quot;Single tenancy vs Multitenancy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The initial aim of a multitenant architecture was to optimise resource allocation in an application. Instead of providing multiple instances of the same software, a single instance of the software was used to serve multiple tenants. But times have changed. Today, 15 years or more after the creation of...</description>

        <title>Continuously Variable Transmission</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;A Continuously variable transmission is a type of power transmission which be called as an efficient replacement for a conventional automobile gearbox with a gearshift. A CVT is a system of belt and pulleys which is used to achieve infinite gear ratios between the 2 transmission shafts. The CVT consists of 2 pulleys – the primary and the secondary. Both the pulleys have one movable sheave and one stationary sheave. A belt (V shaped) goes over these pulleys. The angle of the V belt is equal to the angle between the facing sides of movable and stationary sheave...</description>

        <title>Introduction to big data and hadoop</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-is-big-data&quot;&gt;What is ‘Big data’?&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;In simple terms, Big data is data which can’t comfortably be processed on a single machine. We live in a world increasingly driven by data. Try googling about big data and you will find some staggering facts like :&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;The amount of data produced by us from the beginning of time till 2003 was 5 billion gigabytes. The same amount was created in every two days in 2011, and in every ten minutes in 2013 !!!&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;90% of the world’s data was generated in the last few years.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;A report from McKinsey &amp;amp; Co....</description>

        <title>All about FinFETS</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hello folks, today I’m going to discuss in detail about FinFET technology. The demand for smartphones and tablets with better performance and longer battery life has been driving the industry to come up with chips that are faster, smaller and use less power. To remain on this treadmill known as Moore’s Law, chipmakers have in recent years relied on a series of technological breakthroughs, most recently 3-D transistors known as FinFETs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The FinFET technology promises to provide the deliver superior levels of scalability needed to ensure that the current progress with increased levels of integration within integrated circuits...</description>

        <title>Fascinating World Of Compliant Mechanisms</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-is-a-mechanism&quot;&gt;WHAT IS A MECHANISM?&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;A mechanism is a mechanical device used to transfer or transform motion, force, or energy. Traditional rigid- body mechanisms consist of rigid links connected at movable joints. Whatever machines you see in your day to day life has some underlying mechanisms that govern its motion to produce the desired output. For example A NUT CRACKER works on the principle of MECHANICAL ADVANTAGE based on LEVER MECHANISM. This mechanism transfers energy from the input to the output. Since energy is conserved between the input and output (neglecting friction losses), the output force may be much larger...</description>

A majority of today’s companies are insufficiently prepared for a cyber attack. Unfortunately, very few in NITK have cyber-security as their interest.I hope this interview with Kishor Bhat ,a cyber-security enthusiast motivates the readers into understanding the importance of cyber security in today’s digital world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;1-how-important-are-ctfs-to-a-security-enthusiast-give-an-account-of-your-experiences-from-playing-ctfs&quot;&gt;1. How important are CTFs to a security enthusiast? Give an account of your experiences from playing CTFs&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;In my opinion, pretty important.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For the uninitiated, CTFs or Capture the Flag contests are security competitions that...</description>

He has done his BTech in Mechanical from NITK. He was an executive member of IEEE and SIGHT Chair in 2015. He is currently a Project Assistant at IISc and is working on non-linear control. With the amount of experience he possesses and the ‘air of intelligence’ he creates around the person he is interacting with, it was a great opportunity for me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-one-thing-you-want-mechanical-students-to-remember&quot;&gt;What is one thing you want mechanical students to remember?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;That question can be answered in...</description>
