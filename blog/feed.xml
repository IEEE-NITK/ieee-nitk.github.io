        <title>The Beginning Of The End - Have The Machines Won?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Wondering when artificially intelligent robots will take over the Earth? Wonder no more — they’ve already done it! You’re probably thinking&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;But wait. Wouldn’t I have noticed if chrome-plated autonomous killing machines began to exterminate humans? Not necessarily.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;It turns out evil robots in cyber-space are nowhere near as flashy as their science-fiction counterparts. We envisioned Cylons, Terminators, and Cyborgs but failed to imagine the much more immediate threat of helpful neural-network learning algorithms. I’m talking about Alexa, Echo, Siri, Google Home, the Internet of Things, even social networking platforms masquerading as news sources. They control content. They learn...</description>

        <title>Introduction to Docker</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Docker is probably the most talked-about infrastructure technology of the past few years. And why not? It makes managing and deploying applications so much easier without the overhead of a Virtual Machine. Here’s how:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Docker&lt;/strong&gt; is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. &lt;strong&gt;Containers&lt;/strong&gt; allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package. By doing so, thanks to the container the developer can rest assured that the application will run on...</description>

        <title>The LIGO Experiment</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory) Experiment – A completely different perspective of studying the universe.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;einsteins-prediction&quot;&gt;Einstein’s Prediction&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/img/the-ligo-experiment/image1.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Einstein’s Prediction&quot; height=&quot;294px&quot; width=&quot;270px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Over a century ago, Albert Einstein proposed the idea of something called a Gravitational Wave which was a part of his General Theory of Relativity. The concept of Gravitational waves suggests that, the force of gravity is not an actual force but rather, a distortion in the fabric of spacetime. This was just an idea, as there was no experimental evidence to support Einstein’s claim.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-a-gravitational-wave&quot;&gt;What is a gravitational wave?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;A gravitational wave...</description>

        <title>Wireless Power Transmission</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We cannot imagine the world without electric power. Generally power is transmitted through wires, however there is an idea to eradicate the hazardous usage of electrical wires which involves a lot of confusion particularly in organizing them. Some of these devices might not even need their bulky batteries to operate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here are the techniques of transmitting power without using wires with an efficiency of about 95% with non-radiative methods, due to which it does not affect the environment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In any system of coupled resonators there often exists a so-called “strongly coupled” regime of operation. If one ensures to operate in...</description>

        <title>Making Iot communications easy using mDNS</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A project in Iot often requires multiple devices communicating with each other. This is usually done through sending messages over sockets. To locate a device, usually addresses are used. This is good technique, but due to commom use of DHCP, the IP addresses change constantly. So one needs to keep track of these changing IP addresses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What if you don’t need to remember the changing IP addresses? That’s where mDNS comes into picture.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1 id=&quot;what-is-mdns&quot;&gt;What is mDNS?&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_DNS&quot;&gt;mDNS&lt;/a&gt; stands for Multicast Domain Name System. Apple needed to use readable machine names on a local network without a nameserver, so...</description>

        <title>The Honeycomb Conjecture</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Why do bees build &lt;strong&gt;hexagonal structured&lt;/strong&gt; hives? Why not any other shape? Let us deliberate these questions which troubled many thinkers. &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/img/the-honeycomb-conjecture/img1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;img1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Consider prisms of different regular polygons and assume them to have same height and volume. This means that the one with the &lt;strong&gt;least&lt;/strong&gt; perimeter will require the least material to build. We know that as we increase number of sides in the polygon, perimeter decreases. So, cylinder will use the least amount of material (circle can be considered as a polygon with infinite sides).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But cylinders are economical only if they stand alone. If placed...</description>

You’re stressed out just thinking about it right now, well what if instead of dealing with your wiry bundles and ports and mats and plugs and cords, you could just….walk into a room and automatically your mobile phones, laptops any other appliances get charged. However, mobile devices are not truly mobile if they require connection to power cord.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wi-charge technology provides us finally a way to get rid of the power cord, efficiently and safely.

        <title>Augmented Reality</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Whether you have played “Pokémon Go” or not, you’ve probably at least heard of the game. A special app on your smartphone or tablet makes it look like Pokémon is right there in front of you  while you search for and “capture” the different characters.  This game aquainted the world with this fast growing technology Augmented Reality. This new technology, blurs the line between what’s real and what’s computer-generated by enhancing what we see, hear, feel and smell.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;how-does-augmented-reality-work&quot;&gt;How does Augmented Reality work&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In most augmented reality applications, a user will see both synthetic and natural light.

        <title>The Brain behind a Formula One Car</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The track belongs to the driver, the pits belong to the engineers&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Formula One cars are mean machines. They have been fine tuned for one purpose- Speed. In fact, they are the most efficient mode of transport after space shuttles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Be it aerodynamic performance, super-efficient engines or state of the art tyre management strategies, engineers have scaled new heights in their pursuit for speed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;the-ecu&quot;&gt;The ECU:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, one aspect of the car that goes largely unnoticed is the electrical system. If the chassis and the engine form the arms and legs, &lt;strong&gt;the Electronic Control Unit&lt;/strong&gt;, or &lt;strong&gt;the...</description>

        <title>Robots Can Now See In 3D</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Autonomous robots can inspect nuclear power plants, clean up oil spills in the ocean, accompany fighter planes into combat and explore the surface of Mars.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yet for all their talents, robots still can’t make a cup of tea.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s because tasks such as turning the stove on, fetching the kettle and finding the milk and sugar require perceptual abilities that, for most machines, are still a fantasy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Among them is the ability to make sense of 3-D objects. While it’s relatively straightforward for robots to “see” objects with cameras and other sensors, interpreting what they see, from a single glimpse,...</description>
