        <title>Diving into and Exploiting the Heap</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;At the physical level, computer memory consists of a large number of flip flops. Each flip flop consists of a few transistors, and is capable of storing one bit. Individual flip flops are addressable by a unique identifier, so we can read and overwrite them. Thus, conceptually, we can think of all of our computer’s memory as just one giant array of bits that we can read and write.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since as humans, we are not that good at doing all of our thinking and arithmetic in bits, we group them into larger groups, which together can be used to represent...</description>

        <title>Computational Approaches of Shock Waves</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In this article I would like to discuss the two different CFD approaches while solving for flows involving shock waves.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In flow fields involving shock waves there is a sharp discontinuous change in the flow variables like pressure, density, temperature, etc. across the shock. The first approach is to have the shock wave appear naturally in the computational domain as a direct solution of the governing equations. This is called the &lt;em&gt;shock capturing method.&lt;/em&gt; The second approach is to explicitly introduce the shock wave into the flow and then solve the governing equations for the rest of the domain (between...</description>

        <title>Market Basket Analysis</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;market-basket-analysis&quot;&gt;Market Basket Analysis&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ever wondered how Flipkart knows what items to suggest to you before and after you make a purchase? The is an aspect of analysis created specifically to promote sales called market basket analysis (MBA). In the retail industry, MBA refers to an unsupervised data mining technique that discovers co-occurrence relationships among customers’ purchase activities. The technique is based on the theory that if you buy a certain group of items, you are likely to buy another group of items. For example: while at McDonald’s, if you buy sandwiches and cookies, you are more likely to buy...</description>

        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;alterego&quot;&gt;AlterEgo&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;We basically can’t live without our cell phones, our digital devices. But at the moment, the use of those devices is very disruptive. Wouldn’t it be rather nice if we could just think of the question and a device could just Google it real quick and give the answer? Well, we’ve reached the point where robots can now read your mind. Kind of. Researchers at MIT have developed a wearable gadget that transcribes and responds to conversations users have with themselves in their heads. &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/img/alterego/alterego.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Example&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Comprised of a wearable device and a small computing system,...</description>

        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;idea&quot;&gt;Idea:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regenerative Braking&lt;/strong&gt; is an energy recovery mechanism which slows a vehicle or object by converting its kinetic energy into a form which can be either be used immediately or stored until needed. We have implemented this RBS in bicycles for generating electricity which can be used for different purposes like charging phones. For this we constructed a circuit to convert Mechanical energy to Electrical energy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/img/regenerative-braking/pic1.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;pic1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;implementation&quot;&gt;Implementation&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;RBS is based on the principle of electromagnetic induction. On the application of brakes, the gears on the brakes come in contact with the rim of the...</description>

        <title>QEMU/KVM for Virtual Machines</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A “virtual machine” or “VM” is a virtual computer system. It is a tightly isolated software container with an operating system and application inside. Putting multiple VMs on a single computer enables several operating systems and applications to run on just one physical server, or “host.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A thin layer of software called a “hypervisor” decouples the virtual machines from the host and dynamically allocates computing resources to each virtual machine as needed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;qemu-and-kvm&quot;&gt;QEMU and KVM&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;QEMU or Quick Emulator is an open-source machine emulator and virtualizer. It can be used for full-system emulation, user-mode emulation as well...</description>

Contrary to Amazon’s online website, the Go is a brick and mortar store- similar to your regular convenience store. What’s unique about the Go is that you can pick up an item and just walk out of the store without having to wait in line to pay for it. The store sells ordinary grocery items like bread, dairy and packaged ready to eat meals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/img/amazon-go/1.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Landing image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;how-does-it-work&quot;&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;A customer has to hold up a QR code on the Amazon Go...</description>
