        <title>Generate Strange Text with GPT-2</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;GPT-2 refers to a set of &lt;em&gt;Language Models&lt;/em&gt; released recently by OpenAI. My objective is to find weird ways that GPT-2 can fail, and also some smart things it is capable of. I’ll be using &lt;a href=&quot;https://talktotransformer.com/&quot;&gt;talktotransformer&lt;/a&gt; for this task. It’s a convenient tool that asks for a short text prompt, and then generates several lines of text to continue the prompt (no coding required!).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;First, let’s see if you’re paying attention. Check out the following two samples:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Department of applied mechanics and hydraulics of National Institute of Technology - Karnataka (NIT-K), Suratkal will host a 3-day workshop on...</description>

        <title>Future of Drones</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The word &lt;strong&gt;Drone&lt;/strong&gt; is used pretty often in today’s world. Today the term has broadened to include anything from highly sophisticated $100M Global Hawk to $30 teeny-tiny UDI 839 Quadcopter. Even flightless vehicle such as Drone ship are occasionally referred to as drones.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog_src/assets/img/FutureOfDrones/drones1.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;​ &lt;strong&gt;Global Hawk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog_src/assets/img/FutureOfDrones/drones2.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;​ &lt;strong&gt;Quadcopter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So what exactly is a drone?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is called as an unmanned aerial vehicle essentially if it flies in a controlled way and their isn’t anybody on board. Whether it is controlled by computers or entirely controlled by a remote makes little difference. But...</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Concorde: Why did it fail?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We had it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;From January 21st, 1976 to October 24, 2003, we had a commercial supersonic passenger service, called the Concorde, that would bring people from London to New York in just 3.5 hours, a journey that now takes about seven. Alongside the Tupolev Tu 144, Concorde was an aircraft that could brag about its supersonic speed, at a time when other jets could only manage speeds of about 800kmph.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Over the years, Concorde came to represent class and style among the elite class in England, France and the United States. With tickets costing up...</description>

        <title>Forward Swept Wings</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Forward Sweeping is the concept of having the wings bent in the forward direction towards the fuselage (as seen in the picture of the X-29). Forward swept wings were first developed in the 1980s as an experiment to overcome many of the disadvantages of the rear sweep but little did we know what complications it would bring with it. To understand and evaluate the forward sweep we need to first understand why wings are swept back.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;x-29&quot;&gt;X-29:&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/img/forward-swept-wings/x29.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;X-29&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A wing typically works on bernoulli’s principle where the air above the aerofoil has higher speed...</description>

        <title>Password Security: Techniques and Challenges</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let me preface this article with something: There’s a very good chance that your password is not secure. In fact, if it’s anything less than nine characters long, any attacker could crack it in seconds if he had a decent GPU. Most of us know that ‘password’ is a very weak choice for a password, but there are some of us who think we’re smart and keep our passwords something like ‘p@$$w0r6’: It’s a terrible idea. Change it right now. ‘Hello123’ is probably safer than that. So what exactly is a safe password? And how do you even...</description>

        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;research-an-informal-testimony&quot;&gt;Research, an informal testimony&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;The feeling of working with the author of textbooks that you first read to learn a subject is something beyond the ability of adjectives to explain. However, it is also the time when you begin to realize what you know is barely a fraction of what exists and that there’s always much more to learn. I am extremely privileged to have spent the summer at Stanford Microfluidics Lab as a UGVRI. Now before getting into more details I’d like you to know a little history and the following content is aimed at leaving you takeaway...</description>

        <title>ELF Files in Linux</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever tried to print the a.out file generated when you compile your C program? It prints gibberish! Ever wondered how the computer produces a valid, sensible output from this? Read ahead to find out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;ELF stands for Executable and Linkable Format. ELF files are usually the outputs of compilers. They exist in binary format (hence, the gibberish when printed). This format helps the operating system interpret the underlying machine instructions correctly. ELF is not only used for binaries and executables but also object code, shared libraries and core dumps. Any program is first translated by a...</description>
