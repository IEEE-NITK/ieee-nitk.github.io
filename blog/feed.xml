It may seem like a new technology but history points out that it is no recent development.[ In fact, 3D printing has its roots in the 1980s. In 1984, Chuck Hull, invented a process called “stereolithography” which used UV lasers to solidify photopolymer that created 3D parts layer by layer. A technology which initially began with the aim of prototyping has today secured its place in the manufacturing industry. Today its use is far more...</description>

        <title>An Introduction to Reinforcement Learning</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;an-introduction-to-reinforcement-learning&quot;&gt;An Introduction to Reinforcement Learning&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Imagine you are trying to train a dog to do fetch a ball. What you’d normally do is that you would reward it a snack every time it fetched the ball. The dog would then associate the snack with the act of fetching and would do it every time in the hope of a treat. Ladies and gentlemen, this is Reinforcement Learning. Cue the curtains. We’re done here. ;)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;wait-what-you-didnt-tell-me-what-reinforcement-learning-actually-is&quot;&gt;Wait what? You didn’t tell me what Reinforcement Learning actually is.&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;All jokes aside, Reinforcement Learning is the area of machine learning which resembles...</description>

It is just like how chemists study different elements, their reactivity, their compounds, etc, in number theory mathematicians boil numbers, titrate them, react with numbers and form number complexes (complex numbers).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;group&quot;&gt;Group&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;A group is a set of elements $G = {…}$ and an operation $#$.

        <title>Log file parsing and formats of report generation</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone, today I will be talking about the core part of my work during my summer internship at Samsung Semiconductor India R&amp;amp;D Center, Bengaluru. Our project team consisted of four members and we were given the task to parse log files generated by a testing framework called as Jenkins (now a very popular tool for continuous integration and deployment of source code) and present the parsed data in a HTML, XLSX and JSON format. We were also required to develop plotting and charting utilities for the parsed data in the Excel files.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;log-file-parsing&quot;&gt;Log file parsing&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Log files are...</description>

        <title>Cuba and Candela - Thin shell structures and their strength through curvature</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Before plunging into understanding the beauty of the thin shell structures or even knowing whatgwho the candela in the title refers to. Let us imagine a scenario where you’re at an eatery. You pick up a slice of pizza, and you’re about to take a bite. But it flops over and sags about your fingers. Maybe you should have gone for fewer toppings? No really. Enough experience with pizzas has taught us that folding the pizza slice into a U-shape keeps the pizza from flopping over .&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/img/cuba-and-candela/image001.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;img1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Behind this simple intuition there lies a powerful mathematical...</description>

Why not core electrical? What fascinated you take up SP?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Honestly, in the beginning of my second year, I just decided to choose a topic and go deep into it so that it will help me fetch an internship easily. Having a few projects related to music processing in mind, I decided to learn more about Signal Processing. With the recent boom in Machine Learning applications in SP, I realized that there were a lot of problem statements which could be taken up even at the B.Tech level. Having developed this interest in SP, I decided to...</description>

        <title>Multitenancy</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-is-multitenancy&quot;&gt;What is Multitenancy?&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to Wikipedia, the term “software multitenancy” refers to a software architecture in which a single instance of software runs on a server and serves multiple tenants. With a multitenant architecture, a software application is designed to provide every tenant a dedicated share of the resources.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/img/multitenancy/difference.png&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot; title=&quot;Single tenancy vs Multitenancy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The initial aim of a multitenant architecture was to optimise resource allocation in an application. Instead of providing multiple instances of the same software, a single instance of the software was used to serve multiple tenants. But times have changed. Today, 15 years or more after the creation of...</description>

        <title>Continuously Variable Transmission</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;A Continuously variable transmission is a type of power transmission which be called as an efficient replacement for a conventional automobile gearbox with a gearshift. A CVT is a system of belt and pulleys which is used to achieve infinite gear ratios between the 2 transmission shafts. The CVT consists of 2 pulleys – the primary and the secondary. Both the pulleys have one movable sheave and one stationary sheave. A belt (V shaped) goes over these pulleys. The angle of the V belt is equal to the angle between the facing sides of movable and stationary sheave...</description>

        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-is-big-data&quot;&gt;What is ‘Big data’?&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;In simple terms, Big data is data which can’t comfortably be processed on a single machine. We live in a world increasingly driven by data. Try googling about big data and you will find some staggering facts like :&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;The amount of data produced by us from the beginning of time till 2003 was 5 billion gigabytes. The same amount was created in every two days in 2011, and in every ten minutes in 2013 !!!&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;90% of the world’s data was generated in the last few years.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;A report from McKinsey &amp;amp; Co....</description>

        <title>All about FinFETS</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hello folks, today I’m going to discuss in detail about FinFET technology. The demand for smartphones and tablets with better performance and longer battery life has been driving the industry to come up with chips that are faster, smaller and use less power. To remain on this treadmill known as Moore’s Law, chipmakers have in recent years relied on a series of technological breakthroughs, most recently 3-D transistors known as FinFETs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The FinFET technology promises to provide the deliver superior levels of scalability needed to ensure that the current progress with increased levels of integration within integrated circuits...</description>
