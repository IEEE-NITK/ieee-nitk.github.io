        <title>Radio Frequency Identification</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;RFID technology has been in circulation for many years now. You may have encountered it first-hand while borrowing library books, or while swiping for attendance in school. Recently, the government issued RFID chips to be installed in cars so that we can zoom through toll booths instead of waiting in long queues. RFID technology has also got a fair share of screen time. Remember Casino Royale? Her Majesty’s Secret Service injects Bond with a glass-enclosed, rice-sized RFID chip, so that, in M’s words, “they’ll know where he is”. Here is a little insight into the technology that is taking the world by...</description>

        <title>Machine Learning for Stock Market Investment</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Arthur Lee Samuel, the man who coined the term “machine learning” defined it as the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;A good analogy to how it actually works would be teaching a child to play chess by locking him in a room with nothing but the rules of the game and a record of say, a hundred previous games (and of course, food and water). After a period of five days, the child would walk out of the room as a pretty good chess player. In our analogy, the...</description>

        <title>Evacuated Tube Collectors</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Renewable energy is the key for the planet’s existence in the future. The fossil fuels are non-renewable and require finite resources, which are dwindling because of high cost and environmentally damaging retrieval techniques. Climate change is real. Global warming is real. It took some time to accept this hard fact, but now with the realization, production of clean energy has become the primary goal of countries across all continents.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Great amount of research is carried in improving the efficiency of renewable energy and making it inexpensive. The main objective is to minimize or eliminate the usage of electricity...</description>

        <title>The Halting Problem</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you have written computer codes, then you certainly would have fallen into the trap of infinite loops. Then you might have wondered if there is an algorithm to check if any given computer program runs into an infinite loop or not; in other words, to check if it halts or not. How wonderful it would be if such an algorithm exists! But alas, the truth is that there is no such algorithm, not because no one has found such an algorithm yet, but because there is no way of finding such an algorithm ever.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;halting problem&lt;/strong&gt;...</description>

        <title>Design of Aircraft Windows</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Everything in an aircraft you see is for a reason. Nothing is there coincidentally. And one such thing is the shape and design of the windows.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With increase in commutation through flights, the aeroplanes started flying at higher altitudes, since lesser air density meant lesser drag which directly affected fuel efficiency. Also turbulence due to atmosphere is less. But some modifications had to be done to make the conditions safe for the passengers at high altitudes. So, a pressurized cabin was introduced into the flights. This pressurized cabin keeps the interior of the flight at a higher pressure compared to...</description>

        <title>How QR code was invented</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-qr-code-was-invented&quot;&gt;How QR code was invented&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Denso Wave a subsidiary of the Toyota Group are attributed with the creation of the QR Code back in 1994. Originally it was used to track parts in the vehicle manufacturing industry, but its use and scope has since grown tremendously. One of the main objectives when creating the QR Code was to come up with a new barcode that allowed more data to be encoded without increasing the size (dimensions / surface area) of existing barcodes. This was achieved by including a second dimension.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The QR Code was born.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;working-of-qr-code&quot;&gt;Working of QR...</description>

Imagine managing the electricity delivered to your house like you manage activities like personal banking from a computer!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You will no longer have to wait till the end of the month to know how many units you have consumed- you have “Smart meters,” and other mechanisms, will allow you to see how much electricity you use, when you use it, and its cost. It also comes with real-time pricing, which will allow you to save money by using less power...</description>

        <title>Magnetically repelling ice</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;People can be nervous fliers to begin with. Even when there isn’t a cloud in the sky, there are few words that cause anxiety in some like, “Prepare for takeoff.” But add wintry conditions to the mix, add some ice, and the uneasy feeling can turn to fear.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;how-does-ice-cause-a-plane-to-crash&quot;&gt;How does ice cause a plane to crash?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ice typically builds up when tiny cloud droplets impact and freeze on the leading edges, or front surfaces, of the plane. The ice alters airflow over the wing and tail, reducing the lift force that keeps the plane in the air, and potentially...</description>

        <title>The Beginning Of The End - Have The Machines Won?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Wondering when artificially intelligent robots will take over the Earth? Wonder no more — they’ve already done it! You’re probably thinking&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;But wait. Wouldn’t I have noticed if chrome-plated autonomous killing machines began to exterminate humans? Not necessarily.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;It turns out evil robots in cyber-space are nowhere near as flashy as their science-fiction counterparts. We envisioned Cylons, Terminators, and Cyborgs but failed to imagine the much more immediate threat of helpful neural-network learning algorithms. I’m talking about Alexa, Echo, Siri, Google Home, the Internet of Things, even social networking platforms masquerading as news sources. They control content. They learn...</description>

        <title>Introduction to Docker</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Docker is probably the most talked-about infrastructure technology of the past few years. And why not? It makes managing and deploying applications so much easier without the overhead of a Virtual Machine. Here’s how:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Docker&lt;/strong&gt; is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. &lt;strong&gt;Containers&lt;/strong&gt; allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package. By doing so, thanks to the container the developer can rest assured that the application will run on...</description>
