        <title>Varistor</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Varistor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The name itself might have given you some idea about what it is, varistor stands for variable resistor&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is a varistor?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Varistor is a varying resistor whose resistance depends on applied voltage,one of the special features of varistor is that it possesses non ohmic characteristics, which defines themselves as a non linear type of resistors&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It has two semiconductor elements fixed in a particular fashion (i.e. anti-parallel to each other) as to provide same characteristics for both directions of traversing current&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Its composition might have provided you with the insight that as it is made of semiconductor, it’s...</description>

        <title>Automate The Industries</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;automate-the-industries&quot;&gt;Automate The Industries&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Industrial Automation refers to the use of sensors, robots , actuators in various industrial processes so that we get much better efficiency and the working labour required is low. Although the initial cost of setup of an automated industry is high, but the industrialists will surely be in profit if they apply the automation method as they can produce more no of goods in a limited time and also the quality of their products will increase as the human error in production is minimised.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here are some of the industrial processes in which we can use...</description>

        <title>Why Machine Learning Matters ?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hello everyone !&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This article is for people who want a primer on &lt;em&gt;Machine Learning&lt;/em&gt; and anyone who is curious about how Machines think.If you are already familiar with ML, this may not be the right place for you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;why-machine-learning-matters-&quot;&gt;Why Machine Learning matters ?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Artificial intelligence&lt;/strong&gt; will shape our future more powerfully than any other innovation this century. The rate of acceleration is already astounding. After a couple of AI winters and periods of false hope over the past four decades, rapid advances in data storage and computer processing power have dramatically changed the game in recent years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In...</description>

        <title>Phase Change Material</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A Phase Change Material (PCM) is a substance with a high heat of fusion which, on melting and solidifying at a certain temperature, is capable of storing and releasing large amounts of energy. In the most basic terms, a PCM is a substance which can store and release large amounts of energy, typically in the form of heat. Although phase changes can occur among any combination of the three phases of a substance - gas, liquid, or solid - the most commercially viable transition is between the liquid and solid phases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;working-of-a-pcm&quot;&gt;Working of a PCM&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;A PCM in its’...</description>

        <title>Avionics</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The merging of the words aviation and electronics, Avionics are all of the electronic devices and systems which perform individualized functions, used on any aircraft. Whether it is a military standard drone or a small hobby craft, it contains many electronic components which together achieve controlled flight. In this blog I’m going to talk mainly on the electronics aspect of the equipment used in small scale aircraft and drones.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;accelerometer&quot;&gt;Accelerometer&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/img/avionics/Accelerometer.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Accelerometer&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/img/avionics/AccelerometerIC.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Accelometer IC&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An accelerometer is a transducer that is used to measure the physical or measurable acceleration that is made by an...</description>

        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Segment trees are extensivly used in competitive programming for problems that invlove range queries and range updates.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;For example, given an array A of N elements, answer Q queries (of two types):&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;1 L R : output the sum of elements between L and R&lt;br /&gt; 2 x I : A[I] = x&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A similar version of the above problem for minimum(i.e. to find the minimum between L and R) is famously known as Range Minimum Query. These problems can be easily solved with segment trees.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;naive-approach&quot;&gt;Naive Approach&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;A naive approach would be to answer...</description>

        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;You are probably using cloud computing right now, even if you don’t realise it. If you use an online service to send an email, edit documents, watch movies or TV, listen to music, play games or store pictures and other files, it is likely that cloud computing is making it all possible behind the scenes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first cloud computing services are barely a decade old, but already a variety of organisations, from tiny start-ups to global corporations, government agencies to non-profits, are embracing the technology for all sorts of reasons.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-cloud-computing&quot;&gt;What is Cloud Computing?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/img/cloud-computing/Cloud_Comp.png&quot; alt=&quot;Cloud...</description>

        <title>BIO(logy and electro)NICS</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The living cell can be considered as an extraordinary piece of engineering, where each of the components of the cell work in precise coordination with utmost efficiency. Each cell generates its own energy which it uses to carry out specific tasks, and in the process, produces waste products which are removed from the cell. We are yet to understand the working of DNA and RNA, which are chains of particular bio molecules arranged in a certain order. This preprogrammed nature of life that allows for replication of molecular strands is what grabs the attention of many scientists today, and its...</description>
