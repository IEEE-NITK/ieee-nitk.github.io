                <p>
                    The Women in Engineering affinity group of IEEE NITK aims to increase 
                    inclusivity and acceptance in tech on campus. We coordinate events and 
                    mentorship programs to inspire our colleagues and other women and girls 
                    to pursue a career in engineering. It is a professional organisation dedicated to promoting 
                    technical interests among women engineers and scientists. It was launched 
                    on February 18th 2009 by Prof. Marimuthu, the R10 WiE Coordinator. Our mission 
                    is to inspire, engage, encourage, and empower IEEE women student members 
                    and facilitate the recruitment and retention of women in technical disciplines globally.

                    This academic year, WiE NITK organised a talk series with prolific 
                    speakers from across the technological spectrum, called "Around Her World in 10 Ways". 
                    We had ten amazing accomplished women from all over the globe talking about their 
                    journey in tech and their work. The talk series was truly inspiring. It was 
                    attended by around 200 students from NITK and received good feedback from 
                    most of the audience it attracted.

                    REFLECT was a week-long program organized by the WiE Affinity Group from 25th October to
                    1st November 2019, to help to enhance the professional skills of women in NITK. The program
                    aimed to ensure that each participant was aware of various opportunities available by learning
                    how to discover and leverage them as well to improve their professional profile. The
                    participants were also asked to reflect on their short term and long term goals to help
                    understand the direction they would want to follow. The activities included writing professional
                    emails, understanding long-term, and short-term goals as well as creating a vision board.
                    Certificates and goodies were given to all the participants who completed all the activities of the
                    program.
