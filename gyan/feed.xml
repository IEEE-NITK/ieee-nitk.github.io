        <title>Summer Internship and HIPC-2019 experience - Shanthanu S Rai</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;hipc-2019&quot;&gt;HiPC 2019&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;It all began with our IEEE project. It was titled “Parallelising Graph Coloring for GPUs” and we wrote a CUDA program for graph coloring on NVIDIA GPUs. We improved on this by remotely collaborating with Sreepathi Pai, Professor at University of Rochester, NY during our summer holidays. We got to work with better tools and frameworks specific to implementing parallel graph algorithms. The collaboration led to novel technique called “Hybridization”, which is explained in our paper titled “&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01478&quot;&gt;A Hybrid Graph Coloring Algorithm for GPUs&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The above paper was accepted in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://hipc.org/students-research-symposium/&quot;&gt;12th HiPC Student Research...</description>
