Why not core electrical? What fascinated you take up SP?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Honestly, in the beginning of my second year, I just decided to choose a topic and go deep into it so that it will help me fetch an internship easily. Having a few projects related to music processing in mind, I decided to learn more about Signal Processing. With the recent boom in Machine Learning applications in SP, I realized that there were a lot of problem statements which could be taken up even at the B.Tech level. Having developed this interest in SP, I decided to...</description>

        <title>Peeking into a hacker&#39;s mind - an Interview with Kishor Bhat</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/img/kishor-bhat-interview/kishor.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Kishor Bhat&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As our world becomes increasingly networked, protecting these networks is no longer optional. A majority of today’s companies are insufficiently prepared for a cyber attack. Unfortunately, very few in NITK have cyber-security as their interest.I hope this interview with Kishor Bhat ,a cyber-security enthusiast motivates the readers into understanding the importance of cyber security in today’s digital world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;how-important-are-ctfs-to-a-security-enthusiast-give-an-account-of-your-experiences-from-playing-ctfs&quot;&gt;1. How important are CTFs to a security enthusiast? Give an account of your experiences from playing CTFs&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;In my opinion, pretty important.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For the uninitiated, CTFs or Capture the Flag contests are security competitions that...</description>

He has done his BTech in Mechanical from NITK. He was an executive member of IEEE and SIGHT Chair in 2015. He is currently a Project Assistant at IISc and is working on non-linear control. With the amount of experience he possesses and the ‘air of intelligence’ he creates around the person he is interacting with, it was a great opportunity for me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-one-thing-you-want-mechanical-students-to-remember&quot;&gt;What is one thing you want mechanical students to remember?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;That question can be answered in...</description>

I had this opportunity among many opportunities to interview and talk to Gaurav. In my two years of IEEE and NITK life, I have been in touch with him for only one semester, because he took a semester off in his 7th semester. That semester has been the best academic semester for me. The discussions, the treats, the interactions, the projects, the amount of knowledge that this person has! Oh good lord!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anyway, without any further ado, presenting Gaurav. Note: Questions are in &lt;strong&gt;bold&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3...</description>

What do you think should be done in college to enhance your resume?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ans: One should Work hard to get a high GPA. An important aspect is to work on side projects as well-course projects or your own projects. Small projects help you understand and complete learning. It is ideal to contribute to Big Open Source repositories to understand big projects. Best thing is to try to leverage these projects into your first internship.
