    "description": "Envision is an event conducted by IEEE NITK that allows its branchâ€™s new student members to take initiative and work on projects. First year students often do not have the opportunities and facilities to perform relevant projects that help them in their career. This event allows the first year student members propose new project ideas. These ideas can be pertaining to any fields and is not limited to any particular field like computer science or electronics. A selection process is carried out and for each SIG (Computer Society/ Circuits and Systems/ Signal Processing Society), the best ideas are selected. Theseprojects receive funding from the student branch with all the facilities. They are mentored by the Executive members of the student branch.",
