Additionally, they also mentor freshman student members in selected projects as part of the Envision program. The Expo is an annual event wherein members get to showcase their completed projects for all to see.<br>Due to this year's unforeseen circumstances, the Expo could not be held in the physical form as usual and was held in a virtual format instead.
